Translation :
(1) Mind, body, and family,whatever may be mine, I have surrendered at Your lotus feet, Oyouthful son
of Nanda!
(2) In good fortune or inbad, in life or at death, all my difficulties have disappeared bychoosing those feet
of Yours as my only shelter.
(3) Slay me or protect meas You wish, for You are the master of Your eternal servant.
(4) If it is Your will thatI be born again, then may it be in the home of Your devotee.
(5) May I be born againeven as a worm, so long as I may remain Your devotee. I have nodesire to be born as
a Brahma averse to You.
(6) I yearn for the companyof that devotee who is completely devoid of all desire for worldlyenjoyment
or liberation.
(7) Father, mother, lover,son, Lord, preceptor, and husband; You are everything to me.
