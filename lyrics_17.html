TRANSLATION
1) O wicked mind! What kind of Vaisnavado you think you are? Your pretentious show of chanting Lord Hari'sholy name in a solitary place is only for the sake of attaining thefalse prestige of a worldly reputation -- it is nothing but purehypocrisy.

2) Such materialistic prestige is asdisgusting as the stool of a hog. Do you not know that it is only amere illusion cast by the potency of Maya? What is the value ofcontemplating day and night your plans for enjoying wealth andwomen? All these things are only temporary.

3) When you claim wealth as your own,it creates in you ever-increasing desires for material enjoyment.Your riches should be used for serving Madhava, the Lord of allwealth. Neither is it your proper place to indulge in lust forwomen, whose only true proprietor is Lord Yadava.

4) The demon Ravana (lust-incarnate)fought with Lord Ramachandra (love-incarnate) in order to gain thetree of worldly reputation -- but that oasis turned out to be but amirage cast in the desert wasteland of the Lord's illusory materialpotency. Please cultivate fixed determination to attain only thesteady and solid platform whereupon a Vaisnava ever stands. If youneglect worshiping the Lord from this position, then you willultimately attain a hellish existence.

5) Why do you needlessly sufferthe torment of blaspheming the devotees of Lord Hari, attempting toachieve their eminence, thereby only proving your own fruitlessfoolishness? The desire for spiritual eminence is easily fulfilledwhen one becomes a devotee of the Lord, for eternal fameautomatically follows the heels of a Vaisnava. And that fame isnever to be considered a temporary worldly opulence.

6) The relationship between a devoteeand Lord Hari is devoid of even a trace of worldly illusion; it hasnothing to do with the materialistic cheating propensity. Theprestige of so-called popularity in the material realm is comparedto a treacherous dog-eating witch, and the attempt to live insolitude to supposedly engage in unalloyed bhajans is compared toan entangling network of distraction. Please know that anyonestriving in either of these ways verily lives in the hell of Maya'sillusion.

7) "I shall give up chanting the Lord'sname publicly in kirtan and retire to solitude, thus smearingmyself with worldly honor." Dear mind, what is the good of seekingsuch so-called glory? I will always remind you that the great soulMadhavendra Puri never deceived himself in that regard bycommitting theft in his own storehouse of perception the way youdo.

8) Your cheap reputation is equal tothe stool of a hog. An ordinary ambitious man like you can never beequated with a devotee of Madhavendra Puri's eminence. Under thesway of envy, you have drowned yourself in the filthy waters ofmaterial enjoyment after having abandoned the excellent perfectionof congregational kirtan.

9) Truly, O wicked mind, the glories ofso-called solitary worship are propagated only by false yogis
using unscrupulous means to deceive others. To save yourself fromthese pitfalls, please contemplate the instructions that theSupreme Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu kindly gave us whileaddressing Srila Sanatana Goswami with the utmost care.

10) Do not forget for a moment the twomost valuable concepts that He taught: 1) the principle of dry,apparent renunciation as opposed to real, appropriate renunciation;and 2) the principle of a soul being trapped in the bondage ofmatter as opposed to a soul who is liberated. Don't ever make themistake of thinking that these conflicting concepts are on the samelevel. Please remember this while engaging yourself in chanting theLord's holy names as loud as you possibly can.

11) One is truly a Vaisnava who hasgiven up the habit of falling victim to the ferocious tigress ofwealth, beauty, and fame. Such a soul is factually detached frommaterial life, and is known as a pure devotee. Someone with thisconsciousness of detachment has thereby become victorious over
the mundane world of birth and death.

12) One is indeed detached whomoderately partakes of worldly things that are deemed necessary forliving in devotional service; a devotee acting in that manner doesnot fall prey to the disease of material infatuation. Thus devoidof selfish attachment, and endowed with the ability to see thingsin relation to the Lord, all sense objects are then directlyperceived as being Lord Madhava Himself.
 
 

13) This is the standard of befittingrenunciation, and one who realizes this is most fortunate indeed.Everything involved in such a devotee's life represents Lord Hari'spersonal spiritual opulence as manifest in the world of matter. Onthe other hand, one who engages in chanting the Lord's name withhopes of enhancing his own material reputation finds that all hisactivities and paraphernalia represent only the riches ofhypocrisy.

14) O mind, please reject the companyof two types of persons -- those desiring impersonal liberationfrom the material world, and those who desire to enjoy the pleasureof material sense objects. Both of these are equally non-devotees.The things that are used in relation to Lord Krsna are objectsbelonging directly to the transcendental realm, and thus havingnothing to do with matter they cannot be either owned or forsakenby persons interested in mundane enjoyment orrenunciation.

15) An impersonal philospher is opposedto thinking of Krsna as an object of devotion, and thus beingpuffed up with the false pride of imaginary liberation he dares tocriticize the true devotees of the Lord. O mind, you are theservant of the Vaisnavas, and you should always hope for attainingdevotion. Why then do you make such a loud commotion by calling tome and trying to prove the supposed supremacy of your practice ofsolitary worship?

16) One who falsely gives up thingsthat could actually be used in the Lord's service proudly callshimself a `renunciate,' but unfortunately he can never become aVaisnava by such an attitude. Abandoning his servitorship to thelotus feet of Lord Hari, and resigning himself to his solitary home-- whatever is gained by that exercise can only be the worthlesstreasure of deception.

17) Ever engage yourself in the serviceof Sri Radha, and keep aloof from the vicious snake ofmaterialistic sense gratification. The glory of participating inthe Lord's kirtan is not meant to bolster anyone's ambitions forpersonal recognition. O mind, why then have you abandoned theidentity of being Radha's eternal servant in favor of retiring to asolitary place to practice the cheating process of so-calledbhajan?

18) The most valuable treasures amongstthe Lord's preachers are the eternal personalities themselves withbegging for worthless material reputation, which is cherished onlyby the living dead. The Vraja-vasis are truly infused with life,and therefore they preach in order to give life to the walkingcorpses of the mundane world. All the songs that the Vraja-vasissing about the glories of Lord Krsna are devoid of any tinge ofdesire for fame.

19) Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati(servant of Radha and Her beloved Krsna) always hopes for kirtan,and he begs all to loudly sing the names of Lord Hari. Thetranscendental power of congregational chanting automaticallyawakens remembrance of the Lord and His divine pastimes in relationto one's own eternal spiritual form. Only at that time does itbecome possible to go off to a solitary place and engage in theconfidential worship of Their Lordships.
