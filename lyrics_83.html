Translation:
(1) O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the son of Nanda, which make one fearless. Having obtained this
rare human birth, cross over this ocean of wordly existence through the association of saintly persons.
(2) Both in the day and at night I remain sleepless, suffering the pains of the heat and cold, the wind and the rain. For a fraction of flickering happiness I have uselessly served wicked and miserly men.
(3) What assurance of real happiness is there in all of one’s wealth, youthfulness, sons, and family members?
This life is tottering like a drop of water on a lotus petal; therefore you should always serve and worship the
divine feet of Lord Hari.
(4) It is the desire and great longing of Govinda Dasa to engage himself in the nine processes of bhakti,
namely hearing the glories of Lord Hari and chanting those glories, constantly remembering Him and
offering prayers to Him, serving the Lord’s lotus feet, serving the Supreme Lord as a servant, worshiping Him
with flowers and incense and so forth, serving Him as a friend, and completely offering the Lord one’s very self.
