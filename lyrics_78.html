TRANSLATION
1) With great enthusiasm I spent my time in the pleasures ofmundane learning, and never worshiped
Your lotus feet, O Lord. Now You are my only shelter.
2) Reading on and on, my hopes grew and grew, for Iconsidered the acquisition of material knowledge
to be life's true goal. How fruitless those hopes turned out to be,for all my knowledge proved feeble.
Now I know that all such erudition is actually pure ignorance.
3) All the so-called knowledge of this world is born of theflickering potency of Your illusory energy
(maya). It is an impediment to the execution of devotional serviceto You. Indulgence in
mundane knowledge verily makes an ass of the eternal soul byencouraging his infatuation with
this temporary world.
4) Here is one person who has been turned into such an ass,who for so long has carried on his back
the useless burden of material existence. Now in my old age, forwant of the power to enjoy, I find
that nothing at all pleases me.
5) Life has now become agony, for my so-called eruditeknowledge has proven itself to be
worthless ignorance. Material knowledge has now become a pointedshaft and has pierced my heart
with the intolerable, burning pain of ignorance.
6) O Lord, there is no treasure worth seeking in this worldother than Your lotus feet.
Bhaktivinoda abandons all his mundane knowledge and makes Yourlotus feet the sum and substance
of his life.
