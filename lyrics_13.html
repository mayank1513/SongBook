TRANSLATION
1) My dear Lord Krishna, You are so kind upon this uselesssoul, but I do not know why You have brought me
here. Now You can do whatever You
like with me.
2) But I guess You have some business here, otherwise whywould You bring me to this terrible place?
3) Most of the population here is covered by the materialmodes of ignorance and passion. Absorbed in material
life, they think themselves very happy and satisfied, and thereforethey have no taste for the transcendental message
of Vasudeva. I do not know how they will be able to understandit.
4) But I know Your causeless mercy can make everythingpossible because You are the most expert mystic.
5) How will they understand the mellows of devotionalservice? O Lord, I am simply praying for Your mercy so that
I will be able to convince them about Your message.
6) All living entities have come under the control of theillusory energy by Your will, and therefore, if You like,
by Your will they can also be released
from the clutches of illusion.
7) I wish that You may deliver them. Therefore if You sodesire their deliverance, then only will they be able
to understand Your message.
8) The words of Srimad-Bhagavatam are Your incarnation, andif a sober person repeatedly receives it with
submissive aural reception, then he will be able to understand Yourmessage.
9) It is said in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17-21):
"Sri Krishna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma[Supersoul] in everyone’s heart and the benefactor
of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoymentfrom the heart of the devotee who has developed
the urge to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuouswhen properly heard and chanted. By
regular attendance in classes on the Bhagavatam and by rendering ofservice to the pure devotee, all that
is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed, andloving service unto the Personality of Godhead, who
is praised with transcendental songs, is established as anirrevocable fact. As soon as irrevocable loving service
is established in the heart, the effects of nature’s modes ofpassion and ignorance, such as lust, desire and
hankering, disappear from the heart. Then the devotee isestablished in goodness, and he becomes completely
happy. Thus established in the mode of unalloyed goodness, the manwhose mind has been enlivened by contact
with devotional service to the
Lord gains positive scientific knowledge of the Personality ofGodhead in the stage of liberation from all
material association. Thus the knot in the
heart is pierced, and all misgivings are cut to pieces. The chainof fruitive actions is terminated when one sees the
self as master."
10) He will become liberated from the influence of the modesof ignorance and passion and thus all
inauspicious things accumulated in the core of the
heart will disappear.
11) How will I make them understand this message of Krishnaconsciousness? I am very unfortunate, unqualified
and the most fallen. Therefore I am seeking Your benediction sothat I can convince them, for I am powerless to do
so on my own.
12) Somehow or other, O Lord, You have brought me here tospeak about You. Now, my Lord, it is up to You to
make me a success or failure as You
like.
13) O spiritual master of all the worlds! I can simplyrepeat Your message, so if You like You can make my power
of speaking suitable for their understanding.
14) Only by Your causeless mercy will my words become pure.I am sure that when this transcendental
message penetrates their hearts they will certainly feelengladdened and thus become liberated from all
unhappy conditions of life.
15) O Lord, I am just like a puppet in Your hands. So if Youhave brought me here to dance, then make me
dance, make me dance, O Lord, make
me dance as You like.
16) I have no devotion, nor do I have any knowledge, but Ihave strong faith in the holy name of Krsna. I have
been designated as Bhaktivedanta, and now, if You like, You canfulfill the real purport of Bhaktivedanta.
