TRANSLATION
1) How has one such as I come to Your shelter? Surely it isby Your mercy alone, for You are ever
seeking the purification and deliverance of the fallen souls.
2) You are my only hope, for You are full of compassion andmercy. There is no one who needs Your
mercy more than I. You will surely drive away all fear.
3) No one else has the power to deliver me. O merciful Lord,by Your declaration, kindly deliver this
vile and lowly sinner.
4) I have given up everything and come to Your lotus feet. Iam Your eternal servant, and You are
my protector and maintainer, O Lord of the universe!
5) Everything is Yours. I am merely a servant, certain thatYou will deliver me. I have chosen Your
lotus feet as my only shelter. I no longer belong to myself.
6) Weeping, Bhaktivinoda takes shelter at Your feet. Forgivehis offenses, afford him a taste for the
holy name, and kindly maintain him.
