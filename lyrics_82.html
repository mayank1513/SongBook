TRANSLATION:
1) First of all I offer glorifications to the feet of all ofthe Vaisnavas of Vrndavana.
2) Praising of all of Mahaprabhu’s Nilacala associates, Iprostrate at their feet.
3) I pray for loving attachment to the lotus feet of all ofMahaprabhu’s Navadvipa bhaktas.
4) I offer pranamas at the feet of all of Mahaprabhu’sGaudadesa (Bengal) devotees.
5) With upraised arms I pray to the feet of all ofGauranga’s bhaktas, in whichever country they may reside.
6) Holding a straw between my teeth, I submit at the feet ofall the servants of Mahaprabhu that were
or will be.
7) I have heard their glorification in the Vedas andPuranas, which proclaim that each one of His
devotees has the sakti to deliver an entire universe.
8) (Hearing of their glory) I have come with great eagernessto surrender to Mahaprabhu’s bhaktas,
who are all patita-pavana for sinners like me.
9) What power do I have to glorify them? But out of myignorance and un-mitigating pride I do so
anyway, thinking myself so qualified.
10) Even though I am dumb and unable to express theirgreatness, still my heart is joyful due to my
great good fortune (that the Vaisnavas have accepted me as theirown and Sri Gurudeva has given
me harinama full of blissful pastimes). Forgive the faults of thisfallen soul and make me your servant.
11) They award the perfection of all desires, includingfreedom from death, and even that rarest
treasure not found in this world – prema!
12) All of one’s pure, heartfelt desires will be fulfilledwithout delay. Devaki-nandana dasa, intensely
eager for this, glorifies and prays to the Vaisnavas.
