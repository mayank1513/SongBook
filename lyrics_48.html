TRANSLATION
1) When, oh when will I wander here and there, weeping underthe shade of the trees and creepers
along the banks of the celestial Ganges River in Navadvipa? I willcry out "Oh Radhe! Oh Krsna!", and I
will completely forget about all the so-called pleasures of thismaterial body.
2) When will I be able to live so simply by begging somefood from the homes of the untouchables who
live here and there? I will drink the water of the Sarasvati, andin ecstasy I will roll to and fro on the
banks of the river, raising a loud uproar of "Krsna! Krsna!"
3) When will I bow down to all the inhabitants of the holyland of Navadvipa and receive a bit of
their causeless mercy? I will smear the dust of the Vaisnavas'lotus feet all over my body, and I will
wear the dress of a mad wandering mendicant.
4) When I factually observe that the transcendental land ofNavadvipa is non different from Sri
Vraja-bhumi, then I shall be transformed into a Vrajabasi also.Then I will see the true form of
the transcendental realm opening up before my very eyes, and I willthus become one of the
maidservants of Srimati Radharani.
