Translation:
1) O brothers! This material body is a network of ignorance,and the senses are one’s deadly enemies, for
they throw the soul into the ocean of material sense enjoyment.Among the senses, the tongue is the
most voracious and verily wicked; it is very difficult to conquerthe tongue in this world.
2) O brothers! Lord Krishna is very merciful—just to controlthe tongue He has given us the remnants of His
own food! Now please eat these nectarean grains while singing theglories of Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha
and Krishna, and in love call out “Caitanya! Nitai!”
The next songs is to be sung while honoring the Lord’s prasad.

Translation:
1) O brothers! One day at Sri Advaita’s house in santipura,the two Lords—Caitanya and Nityananda—were
seated for lunch. Lord Caitanya tasted the green leafy vegetablepreparation and addressed the assembly of
His devotees, “This sak is so delicious! Lord Krishna hasdefinitely tasted it.
2) “At the taste of sak like this, love of Krishna arises inthe heart. In such love you should taste these
remnants. Giving up all materialistic conceptions and taking theLord’s prasad, all of you just chant
`Hari! Hari!’” [for more details of this pastime, see CaitanyaBhagavata, Antya 4.234-299]
