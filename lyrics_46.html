Translation :
Krishna is the lover of Radha. He displays many amorous pastimes inthe groves of Vrindavana, He is the lover of
the cowherd maidens of Vraja, the holder of the great hill namedGovardhana, the beloved son of mother
Yasoda, the delighter of the inhabitants of Vraja, and He wandersin the forests along the banks of the
River Yamuna.
(Srila Prabhupada was very fond of this song and sang it justbefore his lectures. In Allahabad and Gorakhpur
Srila Prabhupada fell into a trance after singing the first twolines, and after some time he came back into
external consciousness and said, "Now just chant Hare Krishna."Srila Prabhupada said that this song is "a picture
of Vrindavana. Everything is thereâ€”Srimati Radharani, Vrindavana,Govardhana, Yasoda, and all the
cowherd boys.")
