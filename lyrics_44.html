TRANSLATION:
1) Oh my Lord Hari, whenwill such a day be mine? Developing love and attachment for apure
devotee, my material desires will thereby become weakened andsubdued.
2) However I feel in thecore of my heart, I will behave accordingly, totally free fromduplicity.
Without expecting any respect, I will give all honor unto others. Iwill constantly remain absorbed
in ecstatic remembrance of the Lord by performing thecongregational chanting of His holy names.
3) Just to pass this life Iwill perform only whatever minimum activity is requred to maintainthis body,
and I will become attached only to that which is favorable for theworship of Lord Krsna.
4) I will forcibly rejectwhatever is unfavorable for His worship. Thus worshiping andworshiping, the
time has come that I have to give up this body.
5) These are the hopes ofBhaktivinoda while living within the forest of Godruma. Hiding insecrecy,
he continuously weeps with an extremely eager heart only for thepurpose of receiving the causeless
mercy of the Supreme Lord.
