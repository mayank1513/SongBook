Though these are html files, these are parsed with custom rules. Please follow the template of lyrics_0.html.

To edit file you can open it in any text editor. Some of the prefered ones are Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/3), Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Please follow the styles for stanzas properly where stanzas are put within ![CDATA[<pre> </pre>]] tags to retain line breaks. Note that the translation / purport is not surrounded by ![CDATA[<pre> </pre>]] tags.

An easy way to do this would be using layrics_0.html as template and paste parts from other files in relavant places. However, you may find evenn better approach according to your preferences. Please note that other html tags and styling is not required as this is not shown as webpage but parsed with custom parser.

**Note:** Files with committ message "done" are done.
