TRANSLATION
1) Sometimes in great happiness Lord Jagannatha makes a loudconcert with His flute in the groves on the banks of the Yamuna. Heis like a bumblebee tasting the beautiful lotus like faces of thecowherd damsels of Vraja, and great personalities such as Laksmi,Siva, Brahma, Indra, and Ganesa worship His lotus feet. May thatJagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.
2) In His left hand Lord Jagannatha holds a flute, on Hishead He wears peacock feathers, and on His hips He wears fineyellow silken cloth. From the corners of His eyes He bestowssidelong glances upon His loving devotees, and He always revealsHimself through His pastimes in His divine abode of Vrndavana. Maythat Jagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.
3) On the shore of the great ocean, within a large palaceatop the brilliant, golden Nilacala Hill, Lord Jagannatha resideswith His powerful brother Balabhadra and His sister Subhadra, whosits between Them. May that Jagannatha Svami, who bestows theopportunity for devotional service upon all godly souls, be theobject of my vision.
4) Lord Jagannatha is an ocean of mercy and as beautiful asa row of blackish rain clouds. He is the storehouse of bliss forLaksmi and Sarasvati, and His face resembles a spotless full-blownlotus. The best of demigods and sages worship Him, and theUpanisads sing His glories. May that Jagannatha Svami be the objectof my vision.
5) When Lord Jagannatha moves along the road on HisRathayatra car, at every step large assemblies of brahmanas loudlychant prayers and sing songs for His pleasure. Hearing their hymns,Lord Jagannatha becomes very favorably disposed toward them. He isthe ocean of mercy and the true friend of all the worlds. May thatJagannatha Svami, along with His consort Laksmi, who was born fromthe ocean of nectar, be the object of my vision.
6) Lord Jagannatha, whose eyes resemble full-blown lotuspetals, is the ornament on Lord Brahma's head. He resides onNilacala Hill with His lotus feet placed on the heads ofAnantadeva. Overwhelmed by the mellows of love, He joyfullyembraces Srimati Radharani's body, which is like a cool pond. Maythat Jagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.
7) I do not pray for a kingdom nor do I pray for gold,rubies, or wealth. I do not ask for a beautiful wife as desired byall men. I simply pray that Jagannatha Svami, whose glories LordSiva always sings, may be the constant object of my vision.
8) O Lord of the demigods, please quickly remove thisuseless material existence I am undergoing. O Lord of the Yadus,please destroy this vast, shoreless ocean of sins. Alas, this iscertain Lord Jagannatha bestows His lotus feet upon those who feelthemselves fallen and have no shelter in this world but Him. Maythat Jagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.
9) The self-retrained, virtuous soul who recites these eightverses glorifying Lord Jagannatha becomes cleansed of all sins andduly proceeds to Lord Visnu's abode.
