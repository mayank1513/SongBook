Translation:
1) Chanting the holy names“Doyal Nitai Caitanya!”—Oh my mind dances! Oh my mind dances! Ohmy
mind dances!
2) Oh! Such a mercifulpersonality as Nityananda Prabhu is not to be found anywhere! Hesuffers a beating
from Jagai and Madhai and still gives them love of God! Oh! Whenyour offenses are vanquished, you will
obtain the treasure of love of God! But in these names of Caitanyaand Nitai there is no consideration of
offenses! Once you have a taste for the holy name of Krishna,bondage to this world will come to an end.
3) Oh! When there isattachment to the holy name of Krishna, then very easily the lifeof a living being
becomes successful! Oh! Without affection for Krishna, life issimply useless! At the end of life you will obtain
the beautiful vision of Radha and Syama in Vrindavana—if the mercyof Lord Gaura is received!
