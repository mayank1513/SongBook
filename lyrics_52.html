TRANSLATION
1) When will Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu show His causelessmercy to me by allowing me to attain the
shade of the lotus feet of all the Vaisnavas?
2) When will I be able to give up this false ego which is sodeeply engrossed in sense gratification?
And when will I be able to properly honor the associates of theLord?
3) I will stand before the Vaisnavas with folded hands, acloth binding my neck, and a straw in between
my teeth, sincerely awaiting their order.
4) Weeping and weeping, I will understand the real nature ofthis abode of misery, and I will beg for
relief from the blazing fire of this material world.
5) Hearing about all of my miserable sufferings, theVaisnava Thakura will submit an appeal unto the
Lord Krsna on my behalf.
6) By the prayer of the Vaisnavas the all-merciful LordKrsna will then become compassionate towards
such a sinner as me.
7) Bhaktivinoda's prayer unto the lotus feet of theVaisnavas is that: "Please be merciful and take
this worthless person into your association.”
