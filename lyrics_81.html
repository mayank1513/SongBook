TRANSLATION
1) I offer pranama to that foremost of thieves – who isfamous in Vraja as the butter-thief and He who steals the gopis’clothes, and who, for those who take shelter of Him, steals thesins which have accrued over many lifetimes.
2) I offer pranama to the foremost of thieves – who stealsSrimati Radhika’s heart, who steals the dark luster of a freshraincloud, and who steals all the sins and sufferings of those whotake shelter of His feet.
3) He turns His surrendered devotees into paupers andwandering, homeless beggars – aho! such a fearsome thief has neverbeen seen or heard of in all the three worlds.
4) Mere utterance of His name purges one of a mountain ofsins – such an astonishingly wonderful thief I have never seen orheard of anywhere!
5) O Thief! Having stolen my wealth, my honour, my senses,my life and my everything, where can You run to? I have caught Youwith the rope of my devotion.
6) You cut the terrible noose of Yamaraja, You sever thedreadful noose of material existence, and You slash everyone’smaterial bondage, but You are unable to cut the knot fastened byYour own loving devotees.
7) O stealer of my everything! O Thief! Today I haveimprisoned You in the miserable prison-house of my heart which isvery fearful due to the terrible darkness of my ignorance, andthere for a very long time You will remain, receiving appropriatepunishment for Your crimes of thievery!
8) O Krsna, thief of my everything! The noose of my devotionremaining forever tight, You will continue to reside in theprison-house of my heart because I will not release You formillions of aeons.
