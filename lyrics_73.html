TRANSLATION
1) If your mind is alwaysabsorbed in chanting the glories of Lord Krsna with great care,then by
that process of Sri-krsna-kirtana you will attain transcendentalqualification.
2) You should give up allfalse pride and always consider yourself to be worthless,destitute, lower
and more humble than a blade of grass.
3) You should practiceforgiveness like that of a tree, and giving up violence towardother living beings,
you should protect and maintain them.
4) In the course of passingyour life, you should never give anxiety to others, but rather dogood to
them while forgetting about your own happiness.
5) When one has thus becomea great soul, possessing all good qualities, one should abandonall
desires for fame and honor and make one's heart humble.
6) Knowing that Lord Krsnaresides within all living creatures, one should with greatrespect
consistently show honor to all beings.
7) By possessing these fourqualities-humility, mercifulness, respect toward others, and therenunciation
of desires for prestige-one becomes virtuous. In such a state youmay sing the glories of the Supreme Lord.
8) Weeping, Bhaktivinodasubmits his prayer at the lotus feet of the Lord: "O Lord, whenwill you give
me the qualification for possessing attributes such as these?"
