(1)
kṛpā koro vaiṣṇava ṭhākura, sambandha jāniyā
bhajite bhajite, abhimāna hau dūra
(2)
'āmi to vaiṣṇava', e buddhi hoile, amānī nā ho'bo āmi
pratiṣthāśā āsi', hṛdoya dūṣibe, hoibo niraya-gāmī
(3)
tomāra kińkora, āpane jānibo, 'guru'-abhimāna tyaji'
tomāra ucchiṣṭha, pada-jala-reṇu, sadā niṣkapaṭe bhaji
(4)
'nije śreṣṭha' jani, ucchiṣṭthādi dāne, ho'be abhimānabhāra
tāi śiṣya taba, thākiyā sarvadā, nā loibo pūjā kā'r
(5)
amānī mānada, hoile kīrtane, adhikāra dibe tumi
tomāra caraṇe, niṣkapaṭe āmi,kāńdiyā luṭibo bhūmi

TRANSLATION
1) O Vaisnava Thakura! Please give me your mercy – knowledgeof my relationship with Bhagavan and
the ability to do bhajana, sending my false ego far away.
2) If I think "I am a Vaisnava," then I will never becomehumble. My heart will become contaminated
with the hope of receiving honor from others, and I will surely goto hell.
3) Give me the mercy that I can renounce the falseconception of my being guru and can be your
servant. Let me accept without duplicity your remnants and yourfoot-bath water.
4) By thinking that I am superior (guru) and giving myremnants to others, I will bring about
my destruction. Let me always identify as your disciple and notaccept any worship or praise from others.
5) In this way I can renounce the desire for honor formyself and can offer respect to others.
Weeping sincerely at your lotus feet and rolling on the ground, Ipray that you will give me the ability
to chant nama purely.
