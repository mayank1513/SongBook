TRANSLATION
1) O Lord Hari, havingfallen helplessly into the illusion of this world, I see no othermeans of
deliverance but You. You are the only recourse for the helpless. Iaccept the shelter of Your lotus feet
as essential.
2) I have no knowledge, nobackground of pious activities, nor any history of strictdevotional practice.
But You are full of compassion and kindness. Therefore, although Iam certainly destitute, I solicit
Your causeless mercy.
3) The powerful urges ofspeech, mind, anger, tongue, belly, and genital have bandedtogether to cast
me adrift on the sea of this material world, thus causing me greatanxiety and trouble.
4) After great endeavor tosubdue these material demands, I have completely given up all hope.O Lord
of the destitute, I call upon Your holy name, for now You are myonly shelter.
