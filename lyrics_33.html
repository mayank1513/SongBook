TRANSLATION
1) The human form of lifeis the rarest opportunity for attaining spiritual perfection. Butnow I
am lamenting, because I've somehow or other been born with such anopportunity, and I wasted it
by never worshiping Lord Krsna. Oh, to whom shall I tell the taleof this misery?
2) Having married andentered into the entanglements of materialistic family life, Ipassed my time in
vain. I never got any tangible gain or permanent benefit, onlytrouble and botheration.
3) What kind of world isthis anyway? It seems to be just like a magic lantern show that Isaw at a
carnival, wherein so many shadows and optical illusions dancemagically before my eyes. I feel
great attachment and identification with such a world, and thus dayafter day pass by fruitlessly,
without any purpose whatsoever.
4) When this body dropsdead on the ground then what will remain mine? At that moment, allof my
sons and dearest loved ones will not be able to give me anyhappiness.
5) I work hard just like anass everyday and now I am wondering for whom am I working so hard?I
am still surrounded by so many illusions.
6) I waste every day inuseless, insignificant work, and I waste every night controlled bysleep. And
in every 24 hours I never for one second consider that cruel deathis sitting very close by my side.
7) I live a very carefreelife-style, sometimes eating a lot, or eating a little if I feellike it, sometimes I
see nice things around the town, or sometimes I do not go out atall, sometimes I wear opulent clothing,
or if I'm in the mood, I'll wear something simple. I live socarefree that I never consider that one day I
will have to give up this body.
8) My poor heart is plaguedby constant anxieties about the maintenance and daily turmoilcreated by
my body, my house, my wife, my family members and my socialobligations. All these anxieties
are pinching me and destroying all my intelligence.
9) Alas, alas! What aremorseful situation has arisen! I am absorbed in all this trouble,but I never
consider that all these things are temporary and subject to perishvery soon. After I'm dead and
gone, where will all of my material opulences remain?
10) When my body will bethrown in the pit at the cremation grounds, it will simply liethere
motionlessly. Then many crows, vultures, ants, and worms will comeand playfully sport there.
11) All the stray dogs andjackals will then become very much delighted, and in great ecstasythey
will make a festival ground out of my body and will have a hugecelebration and feast.
12) Just see, this is theultimate destination of this material body. And the most amazingthing is that all
of my material opulences, house, family and friends have exactlythe same destination.
13) Therefore I ask ofanyone who has any sharp intelligence: please give up all ofthese
temporary illusions presented by maya, and kindly search after themeans to get pure devotion to
Lord Krsna, for this is the only really tangible eternal truth.
