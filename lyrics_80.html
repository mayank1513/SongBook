Translation:
1) Lord Krishna is thebeloved son of mother Yasoda; the transcendental lover in the landof Vraja; the delight
of Gokula; Kana [a nickname of Krishna]; the wealth of the lives ofthe gopis. He steals the mind of even Cupid
and punishes the Kaliya serpent.
(2) These pure, holy names of Lord Hari are full of sweet,nectarean pastimes. Krishna is the Lord of the
twelve forests of Vraja, He is ever-youthful and is the best oflovers. He is always playing on a flute, and He is
an excellent dresser.
(3) Krishna is the protector of the inhabitants of Vraja;the destroyer of various demoniac dynasties; the keeper
and tender of Nanda Maharajaâ€™s cows; the giver of pleasure to thecows, land, and spiritual senses; the husband
of the goddess of fortune; the butter thief; and the beautifulcowherd boy of Nanda Maharaja.
(4) Krishna wanders along the banks of the River Yamuna. Hestole the garments of the young damsels of Vraja
who were bathing there. He delights in the mellows of the rasadance; He is very merciful; the lover and beloved
of Srimati Radharani; the great dancer of Vrindavana; and theshelter and only refuge of Thakura Bhaktivinoda.
