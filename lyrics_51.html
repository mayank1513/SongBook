TRANSLATION
1) Oh my Lord Hari, when will I ever be able to realize whois actually a real Vaisnava, the lotus feet
of whom are like a mine of all-auspiciousness? When will I becomemadly overwhelmed by holding
such lotus feet within the core of my heart?
2) Such a revered devotee is always transcendental, freefrom all faults, and fully joyful in spiritual
bliss. Being lovingly attached to the holy name of the Lord, andalways disinterested and callous
towards worldly interests, he is always melted with compassion forall souls.
3) Devoid of any trace of false ego, fully experienced andexpert in bhajana, the pure devotee is
completely detached from all types of sense objects. He is alwaysstraightforward and sincere
both internally and externally, and he is completely attracted torelishing the eternal pastimes of the Lord.
4) I discriminate between the three types of Vaisnavas,namely the kanistha (beginning neophyte),
the madhyama (middle class), and the uttama (highest pure devotee).I respect the kanistha, I offer
my respectful obeisances unto the madhyama, and I fully submitmyself to hearing from the uttama.
5) At that time, when I learn to properly honor such a puredevotee, recognizing his real quality, then only
i will certainly achieve all spiritual perfection by his mercy.
6) Bhaktivinoda always keeps a vow to abstain from speakingany type of envious blasphemy unto such
a pure devotee, whose life and characteristics are always pure.
