Translation:
(1) O Lord, forgetting Youand coming to this material world, I have experienced a host ofsins and sorrows.
Now I approach Your lotus feet and submit my tale of woe.
(2) While I was bound uptightly in the unbearable confines of my mother’s womb, O Lord, Youonce
revealed Yourself before me. After appearing briefly, You abandonedthis poor servant of Yours.
(3) At that moment Ithought, “After my birth this time, I will surely worship You withundivided attention.”
But alas, after taking birth I fell into the entangling network ofworldly illusions; thus I possessed not even a
drop of true knowledge.
(4) As a dear son fondledin the laps of attentive relatives, I passed my time smiling andlaughing. The affection
of my father and mother helped me forget You still more, and Ibegan to think that the material world was a
very nice place.
(5) Day by day I graduallygrew into a young boy and began playing with other boys. Soon mypowers
of understanding emerged, so I diligently studied my school lessonsevery day.
(6) Proud of myaccomplished education, I later traveled from place to place andearned much wealth.
Thereby maintaining my family with undivided attention, I forgotYou, O Lord Hari!
(7) Now in old age, thisBhaktivinoda very sadly weeps as death approaches. I failed toworship You, O Lord,
and instead passed my days in vain. What will be my fate now?
