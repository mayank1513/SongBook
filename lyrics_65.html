ore mana, bhalonahi lage esamsar
janama-marana-jara, je samsareache bhara,
tahe kiba ache bol'sar
(2)
dhana-jana-parivar, keho nahekabhu ka'r,
kale mitra, akaleapar
jaha raknibare cai, taha nahethake bhai,
anitya samastabinasvar
(3)
ayu ati alpa-dina, krame taha hoyksina,
samaner nikatadarsana
roga-soka anibar, citta kore'charakhar,
bandhava-bijogadurghatana
(4)
bhalo ko're dekho bhai, amisraananda nai,
je ache, se duhkherkarana
se sukher tore tabe, kenomaya-dasa habe,
haraibeparamartha-dhana

itihasa-alocane, bheve' dekho nijamane,
koto asurikadurasoy
indriya-tarpana sar, kori' kotoduracar,
sese labhe marananiscoy
(6)
marana-samay ta'ra, upay hoiyahara,
anutap-analejvalilo
kukkuradi pasu-pray, jiban katayhay,
paramartha kabhu nacintilo
(7)
emon bisaye mana, keno thakoacetana,
chado chado bisayerasa
sri-guru-caranasroy, koro' sabebhava joy,
e daser sei to'bharasa

TRANSLATION
1) Listen, my dear mind. I don't like this material world atall. It is simply filled with the suffering of birth,
death, disease and old age. Besides all this
suffering, tell me now that good thing could possibly be foundhere?
2) Wealth, followers and family members they can neverreally belong to anyone. For a time they are together,
and afterwards they all drift apart. All
these relationships which you would love to hold on to, none ofthem will remain for long, my dear mind. Oh
brother, know it for sure that all these temporary things areflimsy and perishable.
3) The lifespan of one living in this world is extremelyshort, and even that gradually decays more and more until
one beholds Yamaraja hovering nearby. Afflicted with continuousdiseases and lamenting in heart-broken grief,
his consciousness thus degrades more and more. Finally one meetshis downfall, and he again suffers the calamity
of separation from his dear kinsmen.
4) Just see here, my dear brother. Don't go for this mixedpain and pleasure of so-called material happiness, for it
is actually the source of all your
troubles. If this is the real situation, then why have you becomethe slave of maya just on account of this miserable
so-called happiness? Do you realize what you've done? If you becomethe slave of maya then you only rob yourself
of the eternal treasure waiting for you, the supreme goal oflife.
5) Just become a little thoughtful for once and reflect backon your own life story, how many demoniac
temptations you were motivated by. Simply to get a little sensegratification, how many unlimitedly sinful acts
have you committed? So now just see the result, the only gain inthe long run is your certain death.
6) Alas! Never having once considered the purpose or goal ofhuman existence, such a person wastes his entire life
just like a dog or a pig. Then at the time of death, being bereftand cheated out of any means of deliverance, he
laments bitterly and burning the fire of repentance.
7) My dear mind, so tell me why you remain stupefied andunconscious absorbed in this useless temporary
sense gratification? I want you to give it up right now, and giveup all hopes for future sense gratification as well.
For the expectation of this humble servant is that you will be ableto conquer over this miserable material existence
by being firmly situated under the protection offered by the lotusfeet of sri guru, your most well-wishing
spiritual master.
