bhai-re!
ek-dina santipure, prabhuadvaitera ghare,
dui prabhu bhojanebosilo
sak kori' asvadana, prabhu bolebhakta-gana,
ei sak krsnaasvadilo
(2)
heno sak-asvadane, krsna-prema dise mane,
sei preme koroasvadana
jada-buddhi pari-hari', prasadabhojana kori',
'hari hari' bolosarva-jan
TRANSLATION
1) O brothers! One day at Sri Advaita's house in santipura,the two Lords-Caitanya and Nityananda-were seated for lunch. LordCaitanya tasted the green leafy vegetable preparation and addressedthe assembly of His devotees, "This sak is so delicious! Lord Krsnahas definitely tasted it.
2) "At the taste of sak like this, love of Krsna arises inthe heart. In such love you should taste these remnants. Giving upall materialistic conceptions and taking the Lord's prasad, all ofyou just chant `Hari! Hari!'"
