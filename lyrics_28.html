Translation:
(1) Just worship SriGaurahari, who is always affectionate toward His devotees. He isthe same Supreme
Godhead, Krishna, who sported in the cowherd pastures of Vraja andstole the hearts of Nanda and Yasoda.
(2) Mother Yasoda calls toKrishna, "My dear Damodara, it is very late. Please come right now,sit down in
the dining hall, and take Your lunch."
(3) On the direction ofNanda Maharaja, Krishna, the holder of Govardhana Hill, sits down,and then all
the cowherd boys, along with Krishna's elder brother, Sri Baladeva,sit down in rows to take their lunch.
(4) They are then served afeast of sukta and various kinds of green leafy vegetables, thennice fried things, and
a salad made of the green leaves of the jute plant. They are alsoserved pumpkin, baskets of fruit, small
square cakes made of lentils and cooked-down milk, then thickyogurt, squash cooked in milk, and
vegetable preparations made from the flower of the banana tree.
(5) Then they receive friedsquares of mung dahl patties, and urad dahl patties, capatis, andrice with ghee.
Next, sweets made with milk, sugar, and sesamum; rice flour cakes;thick cooked-down milk; cakes floating
in milk; and sweet rice.
(6) There is also sweetrice that tastes just like nectar due to its being mixed withcamphor. There are
bananas, and cheese which is nectarean and delicious. They are alsoserved twelve kinds of sour
preparations made with tamarinds, limes, lemons, oranges, andpomegranates.
(7) There are puris madewith white flour and sugar; puris filled with cream; laddus; anddahl patties boiled
in sugared rice. Krishna eagerly eats all of the food.]
(8) In great ecstasy andjoy Krishna eats the rice, curried vegetables, sweets, and pastriescooked by
Srimati Radharani.
(9) Krishna’s funnybrahmana friend Madhumangala, who is very fond of laddus, gets themby hook or by
crook. Eating the laddus, he shouts, "Haribol! Haribol!" and makesa funny sound by slapping his sides under
his armpits with his hands.
(10) Beholding Radharaniand Her gopi friends out of the corners of His eyes, Krishna eatsat the house of
mother Yasoda with great satisfaction.
(11) After lunch, Krishnadrinks rose-scented water. Then all of the boys, standing in lines,wash their mouths.
(12) After all the cowherdboys wash their hands and mouths, in great bliss they take restwith Lord Balarama.
(13) The two cowherd boysJambula and Rasala then bring Krishna pan made with betel nuts,fancy spices,
and catechu. After eating that pan, Sri Krishnacandra then happilygoes to sleep.
(14) While Krishna happilytakes His rest on an excellent bedstead, His servant Visalakshacools Him with a fan
of peacock feathers.
(15) At mother Yasoda’srequest the gopi Dhanishtha brings remnants of food left onKrishna’s plate to
Srimati Radharani, who eats them with great delight.
(16) Lalita-devi and theother gopis then receive the remnants, and within their hearts theysing the glories
of Radharani and Krishna with great joy.
(17) Thakura Bhaktivinoda,whose one and only joy is the pastimes of Lord Hari, sings thisBhoga-arati song.
