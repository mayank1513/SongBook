TRANSLATION
1-6) The cottage in the grove on the banks of Radha-kunda,the great Govardhana Hill, the banks of the
Yamuna, Kusuma-sarovara, Manasaganga, the daughter of Kalinda (theYamuna) with her many waves, the
Vamsi-vat, Gokula, Dhirasamira, the trees and creepers and reeds ofVrdavana, the different varieties of colorful
birds, the deer, the cooling breeze from the Malaya Mountains, thepeacocks, the bumblebees, the pastimes with
the flute, the flute itself, the buffalo horn bugle, the footprintsof cows in the dust of Vraja, the rows of blackish
rain clouds, springtime, the moon, the conchsell, and the karatalas– all these I know to be very conductive for
the pastimes of Radha and Krsna. I recognize in them atranscendental stimulus for making the Lord’s
charming pastimes more intense.
7) I refuse to go anywhere if there stimuli to devotionalservice are not there, for to abandon them is to abandon
life itself.
8) Bhaktivinoda says, “Please hear me, O Kana! Yourentourage and paraphernalia stimulate remembrance of You
and are the very source of my life.”
