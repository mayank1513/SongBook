TRANSLATION:
1) As I behold the wondrousarati of my Lords Gaura and Gadadhara, I enter into the mood of
Their existence previous to appearing in Nadiya (Their Vrndavanalila as Sri Sri Radha and Krsna). It
is simply indescribable.
2) Underneath adesire-tree, seated upon a jeweled throne, the ever-youthful couplenamed Kisora
and Kisori are surrounded by all of Their gopi friends.
3) Sri Radhika and LordGovindaji are decorated with many shining jewels and pearls inlaidwith
gold artwork, enhancing the sparkling splendor of each and everylimb of Their transcendental forms.
4) The meeting of Their twobodily forms has generated a luster that brightens all the worlds,and may
be compared to a garland of lightning (Radha) fixed upon a darkblue raincloud (Krsna).
5) On the occasion of Theirmeeting there is a concert produced by the sounding ofconchshells,
bells, karatalas and mrdangas. Such kirtana is supremely sweet andrelishable to hear.
6) The cowherd damsels ofVrndavana led by Visakha Devi sing the glories of the Divine Couplewhile
the priya-narma-sakhis cool Their Lordships by waving camarafans.
7) Ananga Manjari offersThem sandalwood pulp scented with cuya while Rupa Manjari places agarland
of jasmine flowers about Their necks.
8) The beautiful LalitaSundari holds a lamp of five flames scented with camphor and wavesit
aloft, offering arati to the Divine Couple.
9) Parvati, Laksmi, and thepersonified Vedas cry in great happiness while rolling on theground and
singing of the fortunate position of the damsels ofVraja-bhumi.
10) Bhaktivinoda resides atSurabhi Kunja in the land of Godruma-dwipa, relishing the joy ofdivine love
at the sight of this beautiful arati.
