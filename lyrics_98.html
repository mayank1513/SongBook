TRANSLATION
1) Her splendorous golden complexion steals the pride of agolden lotus flower anointed with a tinge of
red kunkum. Her sweet fragrance mocks the fame of the aroma of alotus flower sprinkled with
saffron powder. She is fully qualified to fulfill all the desiresof the son of the king of the cowherd men.
May Sri Radhika bestow upon me the service of Her own lotusfeet.
2) Her amazing and colorful silken garments make thesplendor of red coral feel ashamed. She is a
garden of blossoming flowers where the maddened bumble-bee namedKrsna performs amorous
pastimes. She worships the Sun-god daily in order to attain thecontinual association of Her beloved
Krsna. May Sri Radhika bestow upon me the service of Her own lotusfeet.
3) Her charming youthful delicacy negates the fame of thefreshly-sprouted leaves. Her refreshing form
is worthy of being served by the cooling moon, sandalwood paste,lotus flowers, and camphor. When
She touches the master of the gopis, She dispels the burning heatof His lusty desires. May Sri
Radhika bestow upon me the service of Her own lotus feet.
4) Although the goddess of fortune, Laksmi Devi, is adoredby other youthful goddesses, who
are themselves, glorified throughout the universe, still she isnowhere near Sri Radhika in the matter
of beauty, praiseworthy youthfulness, or other divine feminineopulences. There is no one in the material
or the spiritual worlds superior to Radhika in the expression ofnaturally loving pastimes. May Sri
Radhika bestow upon me the service of Her own lotus feet.
5) She is very learned in many transcendental arts, such asperforming in the rasa dance, singing,
and joking. She is decorated with many divine qualities, such asloving nature, exquisite beauty,
and wonderful garments and ornaments. Even among the cowherddamsels of Vraja, who are praised
by the entire universe, She is the best in every way. May SriRadhika bestow upon me the service of
Her own lotus feet.
6) She possesses the opulences of eternal youthful beauty,eternal pastimes, and eternal love for
Krsna. Her ecstatic feelings of love for Krsna cause the gopis, whoare also in love with Krsna, to
tremble. She is always attached to meditating on Sri Krsna’sbeautiful form, ornaments, garments,
and pastimes. May Sri Radhika bestow upon me the service of Her ownlotus feet.
7) She is graced with eight ecstatic symptoms(sattvika-bhava), such as trembling, perspiring, standing
up on bodily hairs, tears, faltering of the voice, and so forth.She is adorned with different
ecstatic emotional ornaments, such as impatience, joy,contrariness, and so forth. She is decorated
with beautiful jewels that give total delight to the eyes of Krsna.May Sri Radhika bestow upon me
the service of Her own lotus feet.
8) If She is apart from Krsna, for even half a moment, Shebecomes stricken with wretched
suffering, restlessness, and a multitude of other ecstatic symptomsof separation. When She regains
the association of Krsna after some effort, then all of Her anguishimmediately vanishes. May Sri
Radhika bestow upon me the service of Her own lotus feet.
9) It is very difficult for Parvati and other exaltedgoddesses to attain even a glimpse of Srimati
Radharani, who is dear to Lord Krsna. But if someone glorifies Herby reciting these eight verses, then
She who is delighted by Krsna’s continuous association will grantthe sweet nectar of Her personal
service to that person, who thereby enters the assembly of Hersimilarly delighted girlfriends.
