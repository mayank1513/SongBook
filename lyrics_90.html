TRANSLATION
1) The gopīs said: O beloved, Your birth in the land ofVraja has made it exceedingly glorious, and thus Indirā, thegoddess of fortune, always resides here. It is only for Your sakethat we, Your devoted servants, maintain our lives. We have beensearching everywhere for You, so please show Yourself to us.
2) O Lord of love, in beauty Your glance excels the whorl ofthe finest, most perfectly formed lotus within the autumn pond. Obestower of benedictions, You are killing the maidservants who havegiven themselves to You freely, without any price. Isn't thismurder?
3) O greatest of personalities, You have repeatedly saved usfrom all kinds of danger —from poisoned water, from the terribleman-eater Agha, from the great rains, from the wind demon, from thefiery thunderbolt of Indra, from the bull demon and from the son ofMaya Dānava.
4) You are not actually the son of the gopī Yaśodā, Ofriend, but rather the indwelling witness in the hearts of allembodied souls. Because Lord Brahmā prayed for You to come andprotect the universe, You have now appeared in the Sātvatadynasty.
5) O best of the Vṛṣṇis, Your lotuslike hand, which holdsthe hand of the goddess of fortune, grants fearlessness to thosewho approach Your feet out of fear of material existence. O lover,please place that wish-fulfilling lotus hand on our heads.
6) O You who destroy the suffering of Vraja's people, O heroof all women, Your smile shatters the false pride of Your devotees.Please, dear friend, accept us as Your maidservants and show usYour beautiful lotus face.
7) Your lotus feet destroy the past sins of all embodiedsouls who surrender to them. Those feet follow after the cows inthe pastures and are the eternal abode of the goddess of fortune.Since You once put those feet on the hoods of the great serpentKāliya, please place them upon our breasts and tear away the lustin our hearts.
8) O lotus-eyed one, Your sweet voice and charming words,which attract the minds of the intelligent, are bewildering us moreand more. Our dear hero, please revive Your maidservants with thenectar of Your lips.
9) The nectar of Your words and the descriptions of Youractivities are the life and soul of those suffering in thismaterial world. These narrations, transmitted by learned sages,eradicate one's sinful reactions and bestow good fortune uponwhoever hears them. These narrations are broadcast all over theworld and are filled with spiritual power. Certainly those whospread the message of Godhead are most munificent.
10) Your smiles, Your sweet, loving glances, the intimatepastimes and confidential talks we enjoyed with You — all these areauspicious to meditate upon, and they touch our hearts. But at thesame time, O deceiver, they very much agitate our minds.
11) Dear master, dear lover, when You leave the cowherdvillage to herd the cows, our minds are disturbed with the thoughtthat Your feet, more beautiful than a lotus, will be pricked by thespiked husks of grain and the rough grass and plants.
12) At the end of the day You repeatedly show us Your lotusface, covered with dark blue locks ofhair and thickly powdered withdust. Thus, O hero, You arouse lusty desires in our minds.
13) Your lotus feet, which are worshiped by Lord Brahmā,fulfill the desires of all who bow down to them. They are theornament of the earth, they give the highest satisfaction, and intimes of danger they are the appropriate object of meditation. Olover, O destroyer of anxiety, please put those lotus feet upon ourbreasts.
14) O hero, kindly distribute to us the nectar of Your lips,which enhances conjugal pleasure and vanquishes grief. That nectaris thoroughly relished by Your vibrating flute and makes peopleforget any other attachment.
15) When You go off to the forest during the day, a tinyfraction of a second becomes like a millennium for us because wecannot see You. And even when we can eagerly look upon Yourbeautiful face, so lovely with its adornment of curly locks, ourpleasure is hindered by our eyelids, which were fashioned by thefoolish creator.
16) Dear Acyuta, You know very well why we have come here.Who but a cheater like You would abandon young women who come tosee Him in the middle of the night, enchanted by the loud song ofHis flute? Just to see You, we have completely rejected ourhusbands, children, ancestors, brothers and other relatives.
17) Our minds are repeatedly bewildered as we think of theintimate conversations we had with You in secret, feel the rise oflust in our hearts and remember Your smiling face, Your lovingglances and Your broad chest, the resting place of the goddess offortune. Thus we experience the most severe hankering for You.
18) O beloved, Your all-auspicious appearance vanquishes thedistress of those living in Vraja's forests. Our minds long forYour association. Please give to us just a bit of that medicine,which counteracts the disease in Your devotees' hearts.
19) O dearly beloved! Your lotus feet are so soft that weplace them gently on our breasts, fearing that Your feet will behurt. Our life rests only in You. Our minds, therefore, are filledwith anxiety that Your tender feet might be wounded by pebbles asYou roam about on the forest path.
