Translation:
(1) All glories, allglories to the beautiful arati ceremony of Lord Caitanya. ThisGaura-arati is taking place in
a grove on the banks of the Jahnavi [Ganges] and is attracting theminds of all living entities in the universe.
(2) On Lord Caitanya’sright side is Lord Nityananda, and on His left is Sri Gadadhara.Nearby stands Sri
Advaita, and Srivasa Thakura is holding an umbrella over LordCaitanya’s head.
(3) Lord Caitanya has satdown on a jeweled throne, and the demigods, headed by Lord Brahma,perform the
arati ceremony.
(4) Narahari Sarakara andother associates of Lord Caitanya fan Him with camaras, anddevotees headed
by Sanjaya Pandita, Mukunda Datta, and Vasu Ghosha sing sweetkirtana.
(5) Conchshells, bells, andkaratalas resound, and the mridangas play very sweetly. Thiskirtana music
is supremely sweet and relishable to hear.
(6) The brilliance of LordCaitanya’s face conquers millions upon millions of moons, and thegarland of
forest flowers around His neck shines.
(7) Lord Siva, SukadevaGosvami, and Narada Muni are all there, and their voices are chokedwith the ecstasy
of transcendental love. Thus Thakura Bhaktivinoda envisions theglory of Lord Sri Caitanya.
