Translation:
1) The dust of the lotus feet of pure devotees, enthusiaticdevotional service, and service to the pure devotees
of the highest order are the roots of the creeper of devotion.
2) The holy days like Ekadasi and Janmashtami are the motherof devotion for those devotees who respect
them. Let the holy places of Krishna’s pastimes be my places ofworship, and bless me.
3) May I always visit all the holy places associated withthe lila of Lord Caitanya and His devotees.
4) When I hear the sound of the mridanga in my heart Ialways desire to join in kirtana; and when I hear
the bonafide songs decribing Lord Caitanya’s pastimes, my heartdances in ecstasy.
5) Whenever I see the transcendental sri-vigrahas ofRadha-Krishna I am in bliss, for by taking Their
Lordships’ prasada we can conquer over the material elements.

6) One day while performing devotional practices, I saw myhouse transformed into Goloka Vrindavana. When
I take the caranamrita of the Deity, I see the holy Ganges watersthat come from the feet of Lord Vishnu, and
my bliss knows no bounds.
7) By seeing the tulasi tree my heart feels joy and LordMadhava (Krishna) is also satisfied. When I eat the
prasada favored by Lord Caitanya it is a new life’s experience.(Lord Caitanya was very fond of a green
vegetable preparation called sak, and there is another song in thisbook that tells of the amazing effects of this
type of prasada.)
8) Bhaktivinoda concludes by saying: "Whosoever attains thestage of enthusiasm for these devotional
practices will be supremely blissful wherever he may be."
