the forests of Vraja! (Oh, without such worship there is no meansof spiritual advancement!) Just worship
the lotus feet of Radha and Krishna in the forests of Vraja! (Oh,giving up all speculative knowledge
and materialistic activities!)

2) Just worship Gaura, Gadadhara, Advaita, and LordNityananda, the original spiritual master! (Oh,
knowing Lord Gaura and Lord Krishna to be the same!) (Oh, knowingthe spiritual master to be very dear
to Krishna!) Just remember the dear associates of Lord Caitanya,namely Srivasa Thakura, Haridasa Thakura,
Murari Gupta, and Mukunda Datta! (Oh, in deep love for Lord Gaura,you should remember, just
remember!) (Just remember the two great personalities SrivasaThakura and Haridasa Thakura!)

in worshiping Lord Krishna!) (Just remember the two great souls SriRupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami!)
Just remember Raghava Pandita, Gopal Bhatta Goswami, SvarupaDamodara Goswami, and Ramananda Raya!
(Oh, if you really seek love of Krishna!) (Just remember SvarupaDamodara Goswami and Ramananda Raya!)

who follow the path of Sri Rupa Goswami and who are absorbed in theecstasy of bhajan! (Oh, if you actually
want residence in the land of Vraja!) (Just remember the sadhus whoare followers of Srila Rupa Goswami!)
