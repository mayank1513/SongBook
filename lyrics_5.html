Sri Sri Siksha Ashtakam

Sri Sri Sikshashtaka
EightInstructions
Lord Sri CaitanyaMahaprabhu
Lord CaitanyaMahaprabhu

instructed His disciples to write books on the science of Krishna,a task which
His followers have continued to carry out down to the present day.The elaborations and expositions on
the philosophy taught by Lord Caitanya are, in fact, the mostvoluminous, exacting, and consistent, due to
the system of disciplic succession. Although Lord Caitanya waswidely renowned as a scholar in His youth, He
left only eight verses, called Sikshashtaka. These eight versesclearly reveal His mission and precepts.
These supremely valuable prayers are translated herein.

ceto-darpana-marjanambhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam
sreyah-kairava-candrika-vitaranamvidya-vadhu-jivanam
anandambudhi-vardhanam prati-padampurnamritasvadanam
sarvatma-snapanam param vijayatesri-krishna-sankirtanam

Glory to the sri-krishna-sankirtana, which cleanses the heart ofall the dust accumulated for years and
extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth anddeath. This sankirtana movement is the
prime benediction for humanity at large because it spreads the raysof the benediction moon. It is the life of
all transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean oftranscendental bliss, and it enables us to fully taste
the nectar for which we are always anxious.

namnam akari bahudhanija-sarva-saktis
tatrarpita niyamitah smarane nakalah
etadrisi tava kripa bhagavanmamapi
durdaivam idrisam ihajaninanuragah

O my Lord, Your holy name alone can render all benediction toliving beings, and thus You have hundreds
and millions of names, like Krishna and Govinda. In thesetranscendental names You have invested all
Your transcendental energies. There are not even hard and fastrules for chanting these names. O my Lord, out
of kindness You enable us to easily approach You by Your holynames, but I am so unfortunate that I have
no attraction for them.
(3)
trinad apisunicena
taror apisahishnuna
amanina manadena
kirtaniyah sadaharih

One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state ofmind, thinking oneself lower than the straw
in the street; one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid ofall sense of false prestige, and should be ready
to offer all respect to others. In such a state of mind one canchant the holy name of the Lord constantly.
(4)
na dhanam na janam nasundarim
kavitam va jagad-isakamaye
mama janmanijanmanisvare
bhavatad bhaktir ahaitukitvayi

O almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do Idesire beautiful women, nor do I want
any number of followers. I only want Your causeless devotionalservice, birth after birth.
(5)
ayi nanda-tanujakinkaram
patitam mam vishamebhavambudhau
kripaya tavapada-pankajasthita-
dhuli-sadrisamvicintaya

O son of Maharaja Nanda [Krishna], I am Your eternal servitor, yetsomehow or other I have fallen into the ocean
of birth and death. Please pick me up from this ocean of death andplace me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet.
(6)
nayanamgalad-asru-dharaya
vadanam gadgada-ruddhayagira
pulakair nicitam vapuhkada
tava-nama-grahanebhavishyati

O my Lord, when will my eyes be decorated with tears of loveflowing constantly when I chant Your holy
name? When will my voice choke up, and when will the hairs of mybody stand on end at the recitation of
Your name?
(7)
yugayitamnimeshena
cakshushapravrishayitam
sunyayitam jagatsarvam
govinda-virahena me

O Govinda! Feeling Your separation, I am considering a moment to belike twelve years or more. Tears are
flowing from my eyes like torrents of rain, and I am feeling allvacant in the world in Your absence.
(8)
aslishya va pada-ratam pinashtumam
adarsanan marma-hatam-hatam karotuva
yatha tatha va vidadhatulampato
mat-prana-nathas tu sa evanaparah

I know no one but Krishna as my Lord, and He shall remain so evenif He handles me roughly by His embrace
or makes me brokenhearted by not being present before me. He iscompletely free to do anything and
everything, for He is always my worshipful Lord,unconditionally.
