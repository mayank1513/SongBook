Translation:
1) As a result of myselfish activities, which are without beginning, I have fallen intothe ocean of
material existence, and I see no means of deliverance from thisgreat ocean of nescience. Day and night my
heart burns from the vicious poison of these worldly activities,and due to this my mind never finds any
real happiness.
2) Bound by hundreds andhundreds of desires like nooses around my neck, they constantlytrouble me. In
this ocean of nescience play the waves of ever-increasingmaterialistic tendency. There are also many thieves
and rogues, of whom six are prominent: lust, anger, envy, greed,illusion, and madness. They are causing me
great fear, and in this way my life is coming to an end.
3) The two highway robbersnamed intellectual knowledge and fruitive activity have cheated andmisled me,
and finally they have thrown me into the ocean of misery. At such atime as this, dear Krishna, You are my
only friend. You are an ocean of mercy. Please be kind and by Yourstrength uplift me from this condition
of suffering.
4) Grasping hold of thisfallen servant, and fixing him as a particle of dust on your lotusfeet, kindly give shelter
to Bhaktivinoda. O most merciful Lord! I am actually Your eternalservant, but having forgotten this I
have become bound up in the snare of maya.
