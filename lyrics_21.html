TRANSLATION
1) I am certainly the most wicked person, always performingsinful actions. For millions and millions of births I have not beenable to gain release from this predicament.
2) Who is so merciful within this material universe as topick such a sinner up and take me close to Himself?
3) But I have heard about Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Who isknown as the deliverer of the most fallen. Innumerable sinners
have already been freed by Him.
4) Such an ocean of compassion He is, Who is distributingHis own causeless mercy! When will He deliver me by bestowing uponme His own Divine Lotus Feet?
5) Oh Lord! Now I will really understand the extent of Yourcompassion only if You are able to deliver this most sinfulperson.
6) By what means will I get those lotus feet since I amcompletely bereft of fruitive activities, bereft of knowledge, andbereft of any kind of devotion to Krsna?
7) My only hope is Your compassion, for the opinion of allthe Vedas is that Your compassion is causeless.
8) You are the very abode of purity, and I am most wickedand evil-minded. So how will I attain the shelter of Your lotusfeet?
9) Weeping and weeping, this fallen and most contemptibleperson says: "Dear Lord, all I know is that Your most celebratedname is Patita-Pavana, the deliverer of the fallen".
