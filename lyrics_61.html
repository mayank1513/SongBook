Translation:
(1) When the great soulNarada Muni plays his stringed vina, the holy name ofRadhika-ramana descends
and immediately appears amidst the kirtana of the Lord’sdevotees.
(2) Like a monsoon cloud,the holy name showers pure nectar into their ears. Due to greatecstasy, all the
devotees enthusiastically dance to their heart’s content.
(3) All the inhabitants ofthe universe become maddened upon entering these intoxicatingshowers of
divine sweetness. Some people cry, some dance, and others becomefully intoxicated within their minds.
(4) Five-faced Lord Sivaembraces Narada Muni and repeatedly shouts in ecstasy, while LordBrahma dances
very ecstatically and exclaims, “All of you chant ‘Haribol!Haribol!’”
(5) In supreme happiness,thousand-faced Ananta Sesha sings and calls out, “Hari! Hari!” Bythe influence of
the transcendental vibration of the holy name, the whole universebecomes mad with ecstasy as everyone
relishes the mellows of the holy name.
(6) The holy name of SriKrishna has fulfilled all my desires by thus manifesting oneveryone’s
tongue. Bhakativinoda, the humble servant of the Lord, thereforeprays at the feet of Sri Rupa Goswami that
the chanting of harinama may always continue in this way.

by His Divine Grace
A. C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Thakura. The purport of thissong is that the great soul Narada Muni
is playing on his stringed instrument, called the vina, andvibrating Radhika-ramana, one of Krishna’s names. So,
as soon as he plucks the strings and chants, all the devoteesimmediately respond to him, and it becomes a
very beautiful vibration. Amiya-dhara, barishe ghana. As thesinging goes on with the stringed instrument,
it appears that there is a shower of nectar, and all the devoteesthen dance in ecstasy to the fullest extent of
their satisfaction. Then, as they dance, it appears that theybecome intoxicated by drinking the beverage
called madhuri pura. And as one becomes almost mad by drinking,similarly, all the devotees became mad
in ecstasy. And some of them are crying, and some of them aredancing, and some of them, although they
cannot dance publicly, are dancing within their hearts. Then LordSiva embraces Narada Muni and begins to
dance and cry out in ecstasy, and when Lord Brahma sees Lord Sivadancing with Narada Muni, he joins in
and says, “All of you kindly chant ‘Haribol! Haribol!’” Thengradually the king of heaven, Indra, also joins in
with great satisfaction and begins to dance and to chant “Hari haribol!”
In this way, by the influence of the transcendental vibration ofthe holy name of God, the whole universe
becomes ecstatic, and Bhaktivinoda Thakura says, “When the wholeuniverse becomes ecstatic in this way,
my desires are satisfied, and I therefore pray unto the lotus feetof Rupa Gosvami that the chanting of
harinama may go on nicely like this.”
