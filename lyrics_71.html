TRANSLATION
1) Now that I have surrendered all I possess, I fallprostrate before Your house. You are the Supreme Lord.
Kindly consider me Your household dog.
2) Chain me nearby and maintain me as You will. I shallremain at the doorstep and allow no enemies to enter
Your house. I will keep them at the bounds of the moat surroundingYour home.
3) Whatever remnants Your devotees leave behind afterhonoring Your prasada will be my daily sustenance. I
will feast on those remnants with great ecstasy.
4) While sitting up, while lying down, I will constantlymeditate on Your lotus feet. Whenever You call, I
will immediately run to You and dance in rapture.
5) I will never think of my own maintenance but ratherremain transported by a multitude of ecstasies.
Bhaktivinoda accepts You as his only support.
