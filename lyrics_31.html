Translation:
1) I am singing news ofgreat holy tidings. Lord Nityananda Himself has opened amarket-place of the holy
name in Surabhi-kunja.
2) He is selling the pureholy name in that market-place for the price of only one'sfaith.
3) Lord Nityananda, seeingall the devotees becoming attracted, is selling them the holy nameafter
bargaining with them.
4) O brother, if you wantthe holy name then come with me. We must go to that great soul,Nityananda.
5) You will get the name ofKrishna, I will take my commission and all of our desires will befulfilled.
6) Lord Nityananda isgreatly merciful. Taking only one's faith, He gives the highestecstasy.
7) If He sees only oncetears in the eyes while chanting the name "Gaura" then He giveseverything to
that person.
8) He gives the pureteachings of Krishna to everyone not caring for their birth,wealth, knowledge and strength.
9) Now, giving up theillusory snare of Maya, either remain in household life or in theforest as a sannyasi, for
no more troubles remain.
10) There is no more fearof the age of Kali. the merciful Nityananda gives the holy name toeven the candalas.
11) Bhaktivinoda calls out:"Except for the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda there is no othershelter!"
