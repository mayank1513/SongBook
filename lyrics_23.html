Translation:
1) O jiva, why have youbecome like a fish fallen into Maya's net? You do not know that youwill be trapped in
that net for a very long time.
2) Yearning to tastepathetic pleasures, you remain trapped in Maya's net. Your life isunnatural. You are sick at
heart. Dependent on others, you are punished again and again.
3) By the power ofdevotional service, you will be set free. Playing in the ocean oflove for Krsna, you will take
shelter of Krsna and be His servant.
