TRANSLATION
1) Oh sakhi! My dear girlfriend! What have I seen today? Ina kadamba grove on the banks of the Yamuna, a beautiful blackishboy holding a long flute named vamsi is seated upon a throne ofjewels, performing His pastimes as the King of all transcendentalmellows!
2) Situated upon the eight petals of the jeweled altar isSri Radha and Sri Hari surrounded by Their attendants the eightchief gopis.
3) By singing sweet songs and by dancing nicely, all thegopis satisfy the treasured Divine Couple. Thus I am beholdingKrsna's pastimes with His beautiful female consorts expandingthroughout the splendorous forest.
4) For the sake of the mellows of such pastimes, I will notgo to my home, but I will instead enter into the forest. Renouncingall shyness due to fear of family members, just worship the Lord ofVraja. This is the humble submission of Bhaktivinoda.
