Translation:
1) Gurudeva, give to thisservant just one drop of mercy. I am lower than a blade of grass.Give me all he1p.
Give me strength. Let me be as you are, without desires oraspirations.
2) I offer you allrespects, for thus I may have the energy to know you correctly.Then, by chanting the holy
name in great ecstasy, all my offenses will cease.
3) O Lord and Master! Whenwill such mercy fall to this one who is weak and devoid ofintelligence? Allow me
to be with you.
4) If you examine me, youwill find no qualities. Your mercy is all that I am made of. If youare not merciful
unto me, I can only weep, and I will not be able to maintain mylife.
