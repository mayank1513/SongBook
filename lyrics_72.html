TRANSLATION
1-2) Out of compassion for the fallen souls, Sri KrisnaCaitanya came to this world with His
personal associates and divine abode to teach saranagati, surrenderto the almighty Godhead, and to
freely distribute ecstatic love of God, which is ordinarily verydifficult to obtain. This saranagati is the
very life of the true devotee.
3-4) The ways of saranagati are humility, dedication of theself, acceptance of the Lord as one’s
only maintainer, faith that Krishna will surely protect, executionof only those acts favorable to
pure devotion, and renunciation of conduct adverse to puredevotion.
5) The youthful son of Nanda Maharaja, Sri Krishna, hearsthe prayers of anyone who takes refuge in
Him by this six-fold practice.
6-7) Bhaktivinoda places a straw between his teeth,prostrates himself before the two Goswamis, Sri
Rupa and Sri Sanatana, and grasp their lotus feet with his hands.“I am certainly the lowest of men.”
he tells them weeping, “but please make me the best of men byteaching me the ways of saranagati”
