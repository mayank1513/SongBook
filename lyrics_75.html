TRANSLATION
1) O youthful son of the King of Vraja, You are Lord of alllords. According to Your will, creation
and destruction take place in the universe.
2) According to Your will Lord Brahma creates, and accordingto Your will Lord Visnu maintains.
3) According to Your will Lord Siva destroys, and accordingto Your will Maya constructs the prison house
of this world.
4) According to Your will the living beings take birth anddie, and according to Your will they meet
with prosperity and ruin, happiness and sorrow.
5) The tiny soul bound up by Maya vainly struggles in thefetters of worldly desire. Without Your
sanction he is unable to do anything.
6) You are my only protector and maintainer. Except for Yourlotus feet there is no other hope for me.
7) No longer confident of my own strength and endeavor, Ihave become solely dependent on Your will.
8) Bhaktivinoda is most poor, and his pride has beenleveled. Now in accordance with Your will he lives
and dies.
