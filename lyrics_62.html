TRANSLATION
1) Oh my dear Lord Hari! Bythe bad fruits of my past evil activities, I have slipped andfallen into
the waters of the ocean of nescience, and I have been thus bobbingand sinking beneath the waves for
a very, very long time. Swimming, I have not been able to reach theshore of this ocean of
material existence, for it extends for an unlimitedly vastdistance.
2) Becoming completelysubmerged and drowned in this ocean, I have loudly called out witha
greatly distressed voice for someone to come and rescue me. At thattime You came to me, oh
Lord. Knowing that You are the safe shelter at the shore of thisfearful ocean has given me a ray of hope.
3) You, dear Lord, areactually made of compassion. I am completely convinced that You arethe
original source of the highest form of causeless mercy. Now thismost fallen rascal Bhaktivinoda
won't reject You any more... for I, the befitting object ofcauseless mercy, have attained the favor of
He Who abounds in causeless mercy.
