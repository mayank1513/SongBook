O king, for those who have amassed very few pious activities, theirfaith in maha-prasada, in Sri Govinda, in the Holy Name and in theVaisnava is never born.
1) O brothers! Thismaterial body is a network of ignorance, and the senses are one'sdeadly enemies, for they throw the soul into the ocean of materialsense enjoyment. Among the senses, the tongue is the most voraciousand verily wicked; it is very difficult to conquer the tongue inthis world.
2) O brothers! Lord Krsna is very merciful-just to controlthe tongue He has given us the remnants of His own food! Now pleaseeat these nectarean grains while singing the glories of TheirLordships Sri Sri Radha and Krsna, and in love call out "Caitanya!Nitai!"
