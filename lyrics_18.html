Translation:
(1) In the beginning of creation the science of devotionalservice was received by the four-headed Brahma from
the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna. Devarshi Narada’s understanding ofthis divine science was obtained from Brahma.
The great sage Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa who was empowered tocompile the Vedic literatures, became a disciple
of Devarshi Narada. Sripada Madhvacarya, the founder of thesuddha-dvaita school of Vedanta-philosophy,
who visited Vyasadeva at Badarikasrama in the thirteenth century tolearn from him Vedanta philosophy,
calls himself a servant of Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa. PurnaprajnaTirtha [Madhva] is the guru and sole refuge
of Padmanabha Tirtha.
(2) The two other principal disciples of Madhva are NrihariTirtha and Madhava Tirtha. Madhava Tirtha
accepted the great paramahamsa Aksobhya Tirtha as a disciple. Theprincipal disciple of Akshobhya Tirtha
was known as Jayatirtha. Jayatirtha’s service was for his discipleJnanasindhu.
(3) Dayanidhi received the science of devotional servicefrom Jnanasindhu, and the servant of Dayanidhi
was Vidyanidhi [Vidyadhiraja Tirtha]. Rajendra Tirtha became adisciple of Vidyadhiraja Tirtha. Rajendra
Tirtha’s servant was known as Jayadharma or Vijayadhvaja Tirtha. Inthis way you should properly understand
this disciplic succession.
(4) The great sannyasi Sri Purushottama Tirtha received hisknowledge in the service of his guru,
Vijayadhvaja Tirtha [Jayadharma]. The principal disciple ofPurushottama Tirtha was Subrahmanya Tirtha.
His servant was the great Vyasatirtha [Vyasa Raya]. Vyasatirtha’sservant was Lakshmipati Tirtha whose disciple
was Madhavendra Puri Gosvami.
(5) The chief disciple of Madhavendra Puri was Isvara Puri,and two of his other disciples were the
renowned incarnations of Godhead Sri Nityananda and Advaita Acarya.Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the
spiritual preceptor of all the worlds, made Isvara Puri greatlyfortunate by accepting him as His spiritual master.
(6) Mahaprabhu Sri Caitanya is nondifferent from Sri SriRadha and Krishna and is the very life of those
Vaishnavas who follow Sri Rupa Gosvami. Sri Svarupa DamodaraGosvami, Rupa Gosvami, and Sanatana
Gosvami were the givers of great happiness to Visvambhara [SriCaitanya].
(7) The great souls Jiva Gosvami and Raghunatha dasa Gosvamibecame very dear to Rupa Gosvami. Jiva
Gosvami was a disciple of Rupa Gosvami, and Raghunatha dasaGosvami, a disciple of Advaita Acarya’s
disciple Yadunandana Acarya, was accepted by Rupa and Sanatana astheir third brother. Raghunatha
dasa Gosvami’s beloved student was Krishnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami.Krishnadasa Kaviraja was an intimate friend
of Lokanatha Gosvami. They lived together in Vrindavana and alwaysdiscussed the topics of Krishna with
one another. Lokanatha Gosvami, a disciple of Gadadhara Pandita,had only one disciple, whose name
was Narottama dasa. Narottama dasa was always engaged in theservice of his guru, and he also engaged himself
in the service of his guru’s intimate friend. Thus he became verydear to Krishnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami. To serve
the feet of Narottama dasa Thakura was the only desire ofVisvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, who was the
fourth acarya in disciplic succession from Narottama dasa.
(8) Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura was the siksha-guru[instructing spiritual master of Baladeva Vidyabhushana,
to whom he taught the precepts of Srimad-Bhagavatam. Jagannathadasa Babaji was a very prominent acarya
after Sri Baladeva Vidyabhushana and was the beloved siksha-guru ofSri Bhaktivinoda Thakura.
Bhaktivinoda Thakura’s intimate friend and associate was theeminent maha-bhagavata Sri Gaurakisora
dasa Babaji, whose sole joy was found in hari-bhajana.
(9) These great saintly Vaishnavas are all paramahamsas, ordevotees of the highest order, and they are all part
of Lord Gauranga’s own spiritual family. Their holy feet are myrefuge. I have no real interest in devotional
service, and I am a poor and lowly tridandi sannyasi named SriBhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati.
sri-varshabhanavi-bara, sada sevya-seva-para,
tahara dayita-dasa-nama
tara pradhan pracarako, sri-bhaktivedanta namo,
patita-janete doya-dhama
The renowned Sri Varshabhanavi-dayita dasa [the initiated name ofBhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati] is always engaged

C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who has spread the message ofLord Caitanya throughout the world and
is thus a reservoir of mercy and compassion for all fallensouls.
