ami tomara nitya-dasa tai kori etaasa
tumi bina anya gatinai

TRANSLATION
Refrain: O, brothers, (o brother) The Supreme Lord Krsnawill bestow virtue upon you -- but He will do this
only when Srimati Radharani first becomes pleased with you. This Isurely declare to you.
1) Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, who is verydear to Lord Gauranga, the son of mother Saci,
is unparalleled in his service to the
Supreme Lord Sri Krsna. He is that great saintly spiritual master,most magnanimous within this universe,
who bestows devotion to Krsna in
various places throughout the world.
2) His desire is very powerful, and thus he is causing theHoly Name of Lord Gauranga to spread throughout all
the countries of the Western World. In all the cities, towns, andvillages on the earth, extending to all the
oceans, rivers, and streams, everyone may accept the Holy Name ofKrsna.
3) Thus all directions will be conquered by a flood oftranscendental ecstasy flowing with the excessive mercy of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When all the miserable living entitiesthat have been corrupted by maya become
happy, then the Vaisnava's desire is fulfilled.
4) Although my Guru Maharaja ordered me to accomplish thismission, I am unworthy to do it, being very fallen
and incompetent. That being the case, O Lord Krsna, Your mercy istoday arising in a befitting manner to make
me become worthy, for You are the wisest of all.
5) If You bestow Your divine power, then one attains thefactual substance which is service to the spiritual master
- and life becomes successful. If that service is obtained, thenone becomes truly satisfied, and ultimately
receives Your association due to good fortune.
6) (As stated by Prahlada Maharaja to Lord Nrsimhadeva inthe Srimad Bhagavatam, 7.9.28:)
"Thus, by associating with material desires one after another, Iwas following the general populace by falling into
a blind well full of snakes. My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality ofGodhead! Then the great sage Narada
Muni kindly accepted me as his disciple, and instructed me how toachieve the transcendental position similar to
his own. How could I ever leave the service of your servant?"
7) O Lord Krsna, You are my eternal companion. ForgettingYou, I have suffered the kicking of maya birth after
birth. If today the chance to meet
You occurs again, then surely I will be able to rejoin You.
8) O my dear brother! In Your company I will experiencegreat joy once again. Wandering about the pastures
and fields, I will pass the entire day
with You in tending the cows. Joking with You and frolickingthroughout so many forests of Vraja, I will roll upon
the ground in spiritual ecstasy.
When, oh when will that day be mine?
9) Today that remembrance of being with You came to me in avery nice way. Feeling great longing I called out
for You, O Lord Krsna! Only
because I am Your eternal servant do I desire Your association somuch. Except for You, I have no other refuge.
