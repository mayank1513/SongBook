āsalo kathā bolte ki
tomār kenthā-dhorā, kapni-āṅṭā-saba phāṅki
(2)
dharma-patnī tyaji’ ghare, para-nārī-saṅga kore,
artha-lobhe dvāre dvāre phire, rākhle ki bake
(3)
tumi guru bolcho vaṭe, sādhu-guru niṣkapaṭe,
kṛṣṇa-nām deno karṇa-puṭe, se ki emon hoy meki?
(4)
jebā anya śikṣā dey, tā’ke ki ‘guru’ bolte hoy?
dudher phal to’ ghole noy, bheve’ citte dekhodekhi
(5)
śama-dama-titikṣā-bale, uparati, śraddhā ho’le,
tabe bheko cāṅda-bāul, bole, eṅcaḍe peke habe ki?

TRANSLATION
1) O you have so much tosay about being genuine! You are seen to be wrapped in an oldtattered blanket and wearing a simple loincloth, just like arenounced ascetic -- but in actuality all of this is simplypretentious.
2) Leaving your legallymarried wife at home, you go off and keep the company of the wivesof others. In your greed for acquiring more and more wealth, youwander like a poor beggar from door to door, and you secretly keepso many surpluses stored away.
3) You are quite confidentin presenting yourself as a saintly spiritual master, and thus youare busily engaged in initiating innocent people by recitingKrishna-nama into their ear -- is this behavior not a greatcharade?
4) Can anyone be called a"guru" simply because he gives advice to others? A cook can neveruse whey in a recipe that calls for milk. Now think about this andjust see what I see.
5) On the strength of thetrue qualities of peacefulness, sense control, and tolerance, one'smundane desires are renounced as true spiritual faith arises. Thatbeing the case, the renunciant Chand Baul says, "What will becomeof your premature imitation of spiritual perfection?"
