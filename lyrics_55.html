TRANSLATION
1) This material creationof Yours, O Kesava, is most strange. I have roamed throughoutthe
forest of this universe in consequence of my selfish acts, and Ihave beheld many strange and
curious sights.
2) Forgetfulness of Yourlotus feet has brought on anguish and grief. As I burn in this fireof misery,
my would-be saviors — Kapila, Patanjali, Gautama, Kanada, Jaimini,and Buddha — come running to
my aid.
3) Each expounds hisparticular view, dangling various pleasures and liberation as baitin their
philosophical traps. They are all cheaters, averse to Yourdevotional service and thus fatally dangerous.
4) They are magnates ofkarma, jnana, and yoga who specialize in opinions and proofs forcheating
the materially inclined. Bhaktivinoda, considering refuge at thefeet of the Vaisnavas as essential, pays
his respects to these cheating philosophers from afar.
