TRANSLATION:
1) I have become supremelyjoyful by surrendering myself at Your holy feet. Unhappiness hasgone
away, and there are no more anxieties. I see joy in alldirections.
2) Your two lotus feet are reservoirs of immortal nectarwhere one may live free from sorrow and fear.
I have found peace there now and have given up the fear of worldlyexistence.
3) I shall render service in Your household and not endeavorto enjoy the fruits of that service, but rather
I shall strive for whatever pleases You, fully devoted to Yourlotus feet.
4) Troubles encountered in Your service shall be the causeof great happiness, for in Your devotional
service joy and sorrow are equally great riches. Both destroy themisery of ignorance.
5) I have completely forgotten all past history by feelinggreat joy in my mind. I am most certainly Yours
and You are indeed mine. What need is there of any othertreasure?
6) Bhaktivinoda, diving into the ocean of bliss, devotes allhis efforts for Your service and dwells in Your
house according to Your wishes.
