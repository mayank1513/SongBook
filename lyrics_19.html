Translation:
1) I am an impious sinnerand have caused others great anxiety and trouble.
2) I have never hesitated to perform sinful acts for my ownenjoyment. Devoid of all compassion, concerned only with my ownselfish interests, I am remorseful seeing others happy. I am aperpetual liar, and the misery of others is a source of greatpleasure for me.
3) The material desires within the core of my heart areunlimited. I am wrathful, devoted to false pride and arrogance,intoxicated by vanity, and bewildered by worldly affairs. Envy andegotism are the ornaments I wear.
4) Ruined by laziness and sleep, I resist all pious deeds;yet I am very active and enthusiastic to perfrom wicked acts. Forworldly fame and reputation I engage in the practice ofdeceitfulness. Thus I am destroyed by my own greed and am alwayslustful.
5) A vile, wicked man such as this, rejected by godlypeople, is a constant offender. I am such a person, devoid
of all good works, forever inclined toward evil, worn out andwasted by various miseries.
6) Now in old age, deprived of all means of success, humbledand poor, Bhaktivinoda submits his tale of grief at the feet of theSupreme Lord.
