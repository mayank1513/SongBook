Translation:
(1) Gurudeva! Because youare so merciful, you gave me a place in Godruma amid the woodlandsof
Gauda, with this order to fulfill: “Dwell here in this Vrndavanaand sing the holy name of Hari.”
(2) But when, O master, out of yourgreat mercy, will you bestow upon this servant of yours the
spiritual competence to fulfill that order? When will my mindbecome tranquil and fixed? When will I
endure all hardships and serve Lord Hari without distractions?
(3) Due to attachment to worldlypleasures in childhood and youth, I have developed bad habits.Because
of these sinful acts my body has become an impediment to theservice of the Supreme Lord.
(4) Now, in old age, afflicted bythe five-fold illnesses, how will I serve the Lord? O master,please tell me.
I have fallen at your feet weeping, overwhelmed by anxiety.
