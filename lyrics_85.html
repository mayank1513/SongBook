Translation:
(1) 0 Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of a fish! All glories to You!
You easily acted as a boat in the form of a giant fish just to giveprotection to the Vedas, which had
become immersed in the turbulent sea of devastation.
(2) 0 Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of a tortoise! All glories to You!
In this incarnation as a divine tortoise the great Mandara Mountainrests upon Your gigantic back as a pivot
for churning the ocean of milk. From holding up the huge mountain alarge scarlike depression is put in
Your back, which has become most glorious.
(3) 0 Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of a boar! All glories to You!
The earth, which had become immersed in the Garbhodaka Ocean at thebottom of the universe, sits fixed
upon the tip of Your tusk like a spot upon the moon.
(4) 0 Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of half-man, half-lion! All
glories to You! Just as one can easily crush a wasp between oneâ€™sfingernails, so in the same way the body of
the wasplike demon Hiranyakasipu has been ripped apart by thewonderful pointed nails on Your beautiful
lotus hands.
(5) 0 Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of a dwarf-brahmana! All
glories to You! O wonderful dwarf, by Your massive steps Youdeceive King Bali, and by the Ganges water that
has emanated from the nails of Your lotus feet, You deliver allliving beings within this world.
(6) 0 Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of Bhrigupati [Parasurama]!
All glories to You! At Kurukshetra You bathe the earth in therivers of blood from the bodies of the
demoniac kshatriyas that You have slain. The sins of the world arewashed away by You, and because of You
people are relieved from the blazing fire of materialexistence.
(7) 0 Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of Ramacandra! All glories to
You! In the battle of Lanka You destroy the ten-headed demon Ravanaand distribute his heads as a
delightful offering to the presiding deities of the ten directions,headed by Indra. This action was long desired
by all of them, who were much harassed by this monster.
(8) 0 Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of Balarama, the wielder of
the plow! All glories to You! On Your brilliant white body You weargarments the color of a fresh blue rain
cloud. These garments are colored like the beautiful dark hue ofthe River Yamuna, who feels great fear due to
the striking of Your plowshare.
(9) O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of Buddha! All glories to You!
O Buddha of compassionate heart, you decry the slaughtering of pooranimals performed according to the rules
of Vedic sacrifice.
(10) O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed the form of Kalki! All glories to You!
You appear like a comet and carry a terrifying sword for bringingabout the annihilation of the wicked
barbarian men at the end of the Kali-yuga.
(11) O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haveassumed these ten different forms of
incarnation! All glories to You! O readers, please hear this hymnof the poet Jayadeva, which is most excellent,
an awarder of happiness, a bestower of auspiciousness, and is thebest thing in this dark world.
(12) O Lord Krishna, I offer my obeisances unto You, whoappear in the forms of these ten incarnations. In the
form of Matsya You rescue the Vedas, and as Kurma You bear theMandara Mountain on Your back. As
Varaha You lift the earth with Your tusk, and in the form ofNarasimha You tear open the chest of the
daitya Hiranyakasipu. In the form of Vamana You trick the daityaking Bali by asking him for only three steps
of land, and then You take away the whole universe from him byexpanding Your steps. As Parasurama You
slay all of the wicked kshatriyas, and as Ramacandra You conquerthe rakshasa king Ravana. In the form of
Balarama You carry a plow with which You subdue the wicked and drawtoward You the River Yamuna. As
Lord Buddha You show compassion toward all the living beingssuffering in this world, and at the end of the
Kali-yuga You appear as Kalki to bewilder the mlecchas [degradedlow-class men].
