Translation:
1) The lotus feet of ourspiritual master are the only way by which we can attain puredevotional service. I bow
to his lotus feet with great awe and reverence. By his grace onecan cross the ocean of material suffering and
obtain the mercy of Krishna.
2) My only wish is to havemy consciousness purified by the words emanating from his lotusmouth.
Attachment to his lotus feet is the perfection that fulfills alldesires.
3) He opens my darkenedeyes and fills my heart with transcendental knowledge. He is myLord birth after
birth. From him ecstatic prema emanates; by him ignorance isdestroyed. The Vedic scriptures sing of
his character.
4) Our spiritual master isthe ocean of mercy, the friend of the poor, and the lord and masterof the devotees.
O master! Be merciful unto me. Give me the shade of your lotusfeet. Your fame is spread all over the three worlds.
