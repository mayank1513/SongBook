akrodha paramananda nityanandaray
abhimana sunya nitai nagarebeday
(2)
adhama patita jiver dvare dvaregiya
hari-nama maha-mantra dicchenbilaiya
(3)
jare dekhe tare kohe dante trnadhori’
amare kiniya loho bologaura-hari
(4)
eto boli’ nityananda bhume gadijay
sonara parvata jeno dhulatelotay
(5)
heno avatare jar rati najanmilo
locan bole sei papi elo argelo

TRANSLATION
1) The noble Lord Nityananda is never angry, for He is thepersonification of supreme transcendental bliss. Devoid
of any concept of false ego, Nitai wanders about the town.
2) Going from door to door in the residences of the mostfallen and wretched souls, He freely distributes the gift of
the Hari-nama mahamantra.
3) He exclaims to whomever he sees while holding strawbetween his teeth, “Please purchase me by
worshipping Gaurahari!”
4) Saying thus, Nityananda Prabhu rolls about on the ground,appearing like a golden mountain tumbling in the dust.
5) Locana Dasa Thakura says, “Whoever has not experiencedthe awakening of affection for such an avatara as
this, that sinful person simply comes and goes uselessly in thecycle of repeated birth and death.”
