TRANSLATION :
1) When the rising sun appeared in the East, the jewel ofthe twice-born, Lord Gaurasundara, awakened,
and, taking His devotees with Him, He went all over the countrysidetowns and villages
2) and played the mridanga, and the cymbals chimed in time.Lord Gauranga’s shimmering golden features
danced, and His footbells jingled.
3) All the devotees chanted the names Mukunda, Madhava,Yadava and Hari, their mouths being filled with
the vibrations. They would announce to the still sleeping people,"You spend your nights uselessly sleeping
and your days decorating your bodies!
4) You have achieved such a rare human body, but you do notcare for this gift. You remain not serving the
darling of Yasoda and slowly fall through your last moments todeath.
5) With every rising and setting of the sun, a day passesand is lost. Then, why do you remain idle and not
serve the Lord of the heart?
6) This temporary life is full of various miseries. Takeshelter of the holy name as your only business.
7) To penetrate the darkness of ignorance and blesseveryone’s heart, the holy name has risen like the shining sun.
8) Drink the pure nectar of the holy name. There is nothingbut the name to be had in the fourteen worlds. It
has filled the soul of Sri Bhaktivinoda Thakura.
