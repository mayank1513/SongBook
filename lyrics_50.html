TRANSLATION
1) When, oh when will such a condition be mine? Renouncingall of my mundane desires which are
giving rise to various types of bondage, I will give up this dark,ghastly material existence.
2) I will build my small hut at Navadvipa-dhama, seeing theland as being non-different from
Vrndavana-dhama. There I will finally establish my relationshipunder the shelter of the lotus feet of
the Son of Mother Saci.
3) Living in a solitary place in a spiritually consciousforest on the banks of the Ganga, I will
incessantly drink the pure nectar of Krsna's name, and I willloudly shout the name of Gauranga thus.
4) "Oh Gaura-Nitai! You two Brothers are the only truefriend of all the fallen souls! I am the lowest of
the low, most fallen and wicked-minded, so kindly bestow Your oceanof mercy upon me.
5) Thus repeatedly sobbing and calling out, I will roam allover the abode of 32 square miles, sometimes
on one bank of the Ganga and sometime on the other. And sometimes,while wandering about, if I
ever receive a drop of good fortune, I may suddenly glance over atthe base of a tree (and behold
some vision there.)
6) I will blurt out: "Ha Ha, how wonderful! What amazingthing have I seen now?!!", and I will
faint senseless on the spot. Regaining consciousness later, I willhide and weep secretly, remembering
that all this ecstasy is due to receiving just a tiny speck of SriSri Gaura-Nitai's mercy.
