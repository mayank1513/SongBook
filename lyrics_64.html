Translation:
1) 0 venerable Vaishnava, O ocean of mercy, be merciful untoyour servant. Give me the shade of your lotus
feet and purify me. I hold on to your lotus feet.
2) Teach me to control my six passions; rectify my sixfaults, bestow upon me the six qualities, and offer unto
me the six kinds of holy association.
3) I do not find the strength to carry on alone thesankirtana of the holy name of Hari. Please bless me by
giving me just one drop of faith with which to obtain the greattreasure of the holy name of Krishna.
4) Krishna is yours; you have the power to give Him to me. Iam simply running behind you shouting,
"Krishna! Krishna!"

The six faults are overeating, attachment to material things,inability to follow regulative principles,
sense gratification, useless idle talk, and impure habits. The sixpositive qualities are enthusiasm in
practicing devotional service, firm faith in devotional processes,a strong desire to attain prema-bhakti, a
favorable service attitude, avoidance of non-devotees, andappreciation of the company of devotees. The
six methods of association are to go to an assembly of devotees, toinvite devotees into one’s home, to discuss
and hear devotional topics, to take the maha-prasada of devoteesand to offer maha-prasada to devotees.
