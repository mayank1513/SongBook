    <h5 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic">by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura</h5>

<i><small>Cakravarti Thakura, who appeared in the middle of the seventeenth century, 
is a great spiritual master in the Krishna conscious chain of gurus and disciples. He says,
 "One who, with great care and attention, loudly recites this beautiful prayer to the 
 spiritual master during the brahma-muhurta obtains direct service to Krishna, the Lord of Vrindavana,
  at the time of his death."</small></i>

The spiritual master is receiving benediction from the ocean ofmercy. Just as a cloud pours water on a forest fire to extinguishit, so the spiritual master delivers the materially afflicted worldby extinguishing the blazing fire of material existence. I offer myrespectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritualmaster, who is an ocean of auspicious qualities.

Chanting the holy name, dancing in ecstasy, singing, and playingmusical instruments, the spiritual master is always gladdened bythe sankirtana movement of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Because he isrelishing the mellows of pure devotion within his mind, sometimeshis hair stands on end, he feels quivering in his body, and tearsflow from his eyes like waves. I offer my respectful obeisancesunto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.

The spiritual master is always offering Krishna four kinds ofdelicious food [analyzed as that which is licked, chewed, drunk,and sucked]. When the spiritual master sees that the devotees aresatisfied by eating bhagavat-prasada, he is satisfied. I offer myrespectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritualmaster.

By the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the benedictionof Krishna. Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannotmake any advancement. Therefore, I should always remember andpraise the spiritual master. At least three times a day I shouldoffer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritualmaster.
