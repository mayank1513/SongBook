TRANSLATION
1) His abundantly beautiful complexion belittles thesplendor of combined rain clouds, black eye
cosmetics, and sapphires. His garments appear effulgent like arising sun tinted like kunkum
powder enhanced by shining bolts of lightning. His perfectly-formedlimbs are anointed with
sandalwood paste mixed with camphor and saffron. May Sri Krsna, theSon of the king of the
cowherd men, grant me the service of His own lotus feet.
2) He wears shark-shaped earrings that dance very expertlyupon His cheeks. The beauty of the orb of
His face destroys the pride of the multitude of moons and lotusflowers. He causes the knot of His
own secret ecstatic love-moods to increasingly tighten amongst thegopis. May Sri Krsna, the Son of
the king of the cowherd men, grant me the service of His own lotusfeet.
3) He is eternally engaged in designing ever-freshvariations of His youthful form, mode of dress,
and loving pastimes. He is surrounded by the assembly of Hiscowherd boyfriends, who excel in giving
Him delight by their playful joking words. Even a single brilliantray of splendor from His personal
pleasure-forest defeats the heavenly Nandana gardens of Lord Indra.May Sri Krsna, the Son of the king
of the cowherd men, grant me the service of His own lotus feet.
4) He is delighted by the friendship of His devotees, whoseconsciousness is decorated with
golden ornaments of pure love for Him. He is praised by greatdemigods who protect various planets in
the universe and who offer obeisances to Him by touching theirforeheads to the ground. He honors
the brahmanas with great reverence at specific times of the day.May Sri Krsna, the Son of the king of
the cowherd men, grant me the service of His own lotus feet.
5) He easily removed the pride of Indra as well as theviolent anger of Kaliya, and He killed the demons
like Kamsa and Vatasura. With the rainfall of these variegatedpastimes, He nourishes the chataka
birds who are His devotees. By performing His pastimes of heroicnature, He delights the residents of
His own cowherd community. May Sri Krsna, the Son of the king ofthe cowherd men, grant me the
service of His own lotus feet.
6) He satisfies Sri Radhika and the other gopis with thenectar of the sportive rasa dance performed in
the groves of Vrndavana. During the various intrigues of thoseamorous pastimes, He devises many
playful jokes to sustain the assmebly of gopis. He thus delightsthe minds of all people in the universe
by the glory of His loving pastimes. May Sri Krsna, the Son of theking of the cowherd men, grant me
the service of His own lotus feet.
7) By revealing His pastimes of festive rasa dance, He alsoshows the eternal path of His pure
devotional service. By His amazing beauty and fascinating mode ofdress, He churns the minds of a
vast multitude of cupids. Through the outer corners of His eyes, Hecasts sidelong glances, aimed at
the gopis, that give hints of a host of affectionate ecstaticmoods. May Sri Krsna, the Son of the king of
the cowherd men, grant me the service of His own lotus feet.
8) He becomes excited with desire by suddenly touching SriRadhika while She is busy picking
flowers. Then He becomes jubilant when He sees Her charming facedecorated with the contrariness
of pure love. Verily He is the sandlewood paste that decoratesRadhika’s breasts. May Sri Krsna, the Son
of the king of the cowherd men, grant me the service of His ownlotus feet.
9) It is very difficult for Laksmi Devi and other exaltedgods and goddesses to attain even a glimpse of
Sri Krsna, who is very dear to Sri Radhika. But if someoneglorifies Him by reciting these eight verses
with full attention, then He who is delighted by the intimate ofassociation with Radhika’s limbs will
become pleased with that person and engage them in the service ofHis own lotus feet within the
cowherd forests of Goloka Vrndavana.
