ore o tor mukhe aguna jihvetule

TRANSLATION
Refrain: Oh, why does my heart not weep from chanting the holynames Hare Krsna?
1) The bird of my heartdoes not know what past sinful activities it has committed to causethis inability to chant
Hare Krsna properly.
2) O forest bird! I havekept something for you very carefully within the cottage of myheart – the holy name of
Hari, which is overflowing with puresweet honey. O bird, you couldlearn the chanting of this name if you were taught.
3) A bird is easily able tospeak all names; why then does this bird of my heart refuse tochant Hare Krsna? Oh,
why does my heart not weep from chanting the holy names HareKrsna?
4) O bird! Come, let us goto the spiritual world, the land of true and everlasting beauty. Itis the place where
the imaginary man of my mind will never again come and go on therevolving cycle of birth and death.
5) O bird! At the time ofdeath, your body will simply be placed upon a funeral stretcher,lifted on the shoulders
of four persons and carried to the cremation grounds.
6) Alas! The cremation firewill enter your mouth and then totally consume your tongue. Therewill be nothing
you can do to save yourself, for at that time it is too late – youwill be unable to speak anymore.
