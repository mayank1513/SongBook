Translation:
1)Glory, glory to the aratiLalita and the gopis offer to Sri Sri Radha and Krishna!
2) Wearing yellow garmentsand a charming peacock-feather crown, threefold-bending Krishna ismore
handsome than Kamadeva.
3) Dressed in bluegarments, Her complexion fair, and Her virtues glorious, KingVrishabhanu's daughter is
on playful Krishna's left.
4) Her many ornamentsglisten. Her splendid face charms Krishna's heart.
5) Visakha and the othersakhis sing songs in many ragas. With camaras thepriya-narma-sakhis fan the
divine couple.
6) Yearning to attain thelotus feet of Sri Sri Radha-Krishna, Bhaktivinoda floats inhappiness at the gopis' feet.
