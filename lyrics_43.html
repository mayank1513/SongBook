Translation:
(1) O brothers, chant“Hari!” Chant “Hari!” Chant “Hari!” Lord Gauranga and Lord Nitaihave brought the
holy name! (Seeing our unhappiness! )
(2) Except for the holyname, there is no other treasure for the soul! By the influence ofthe holy name, even
Jagai and Madhai became pure! (They were both greatly sinfulpersons!)
(3) I pass my life uselesslybound by Maya! (Always saying “I” and “mine”! ) Wandering here andthere under
the control of mundane desires—where shall I go next? (There is noend to worldly desires!)
(4) O brothers, chant“Hari!” while looking directly in the face of material desire!(Freedom from
mundane hankerings is the platform of actual happiness!) Giving upall desire for mundane enjoyment
and liberation, I chant the holy names of the Supreme Lord! (Havingbecome pure and situated in transcendence!)
(5) I dance in ecstasy dueto the power and divine qualities of the holy name, and thus Iobtain all these
results! ( Having given up all endeavors for insignificant materialresults!) Bhaktivinoda says, “I conquer
all impediments to the pure chanting of the holy name! ( Havinggiven up all offenses to the holy name!)”
