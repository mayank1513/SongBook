TRANSLATION
1) Krsna who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He
is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes.
2) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor who is tending the cows, yielding all desire,
in abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by millions of purpose trees, always served with
great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of lakshmis or gopis.
3) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept in playing on His flute, with blooming eyes like
lotus petals with head decked with peacock's feather, with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of
blue clouds, and His unique loveliness charming millions of Cupids.
4) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, round whose neck is swinging a garland of flowers beautified
with the moon-locket, whose two hands are adorned with the flute and jeweled ornaments, who
always revels in pastimes of love, whose graceful threefold-bending form of Syamasundara is
eternally manifest.
5) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is full of bliss, truth, substantiality
and is thus full of the most dazzling splendor. Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses
in Himself, the full-fledged functions of all the organs, and eternally sees, maintains and manifests
the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane.
6) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is inaccessible to the Vedas, but obtainable by pure
unalloyed devotion of the soul, who is without a second, who is not subject to decay, is without
a beginning, whose form is endless, who is the beginning, and the eternal purusha; yet He is a
person possessing the beauty of blooming youth.
7) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, only the tip of the toe of whose lotus feet is approached by
the yogis who aspire after the transcendental and betake themselves to pranayama by drilling
the respiration; or by the jnanis who try to find out the non-differentiated Brahman by the process
of elimination of the mundane, extending over thousands of millions of years.
8) He is an undifferentiated entity as there is no distinction between potency and the possessor thereof.
In His work of creation of millions of worlds, His potency remains inseparable. All the universes exist in
Him and He is present in His fullness in every one of the atoms that are scattered throughout the
universe, at one and the same time. Such is the primeval Lord whom I adore.
9) I adore the same Govinda, the primeval Lord, in whose praise men, who are imbued with devotion,
sing the mantra-suktas told by the Vedas, by gaining their appropriate beauty, greatness,
thrones, conveyances and ornaments.
10) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, residing in His own realm, Goloka, with Radha, resembling
His own spiritual figure, the embodiment of the ecstatic potency possessed of the sixty-four
artistic activities, in the company of Her confidantes [sakhis], embodiments of the extensions of Her
bodily form, permeated and vitalized by His ever-blissful spiritual rasa.
11) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Syamasundara, Krishna Himself with
inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart of hearts with the eye
of devotion tinged with the salve of love.
12) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who manifested Himself personally as Krishna and the
different avataras in the world in the forms of Rama, Nrisimha, Vamana, etc., as His subjective portions.
13) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose effulgence is the source of the nondifferentiated
Brahman mentioned in the Upanishads, being differentiated from the infinity of glories of the
mundane universe appears as the indivisible, infinite, limitless, truth.
14) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is the absolute substantive principle being the
ultimate entity in the form of the support of all existence whose external potency embodies the
threefold mundane qualities, viz., sattva, rajas, and tamas and diffuses the Vedic knowledge regarding
the mundane world.
15) I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose glory ever triumphantly dominates the mundane world
by the activity of His own pastimes, being reflected in the mind of recollecting souls as the
transcendental entity of ever-blissful cognitive rasa.
16) Lowest of all is located Devi-dhama [mundane world], next above it is Mahesa-dhama [abode
of Mahesa]; above Mahesa-dhama is placed Hari-dhama [abode of Hari] and above them all is
located Krishna's own realm named Goloka. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, who has allotted
their respective authorities to the rulers of those graded realms.
17) The external potency Maya who is of the nature of the shadow of the cit potency, is worshiped by
all people as Durga, the creating, preserving and destroying agency of this mundane world. I adore
the primeval Lord Govinda in accordance with whose will Durga conducts herself.
18) Just as milk is transformed into curd by the action of acids, but yet the effect curd is neither same
as, nor different from, its cause, viz., milk, so I adore the primeval Lord Govinda of whom the state
of Sambhu is a transformation for the performance of the work of destruction.
19) The light of one candle being communicated to other candles, although it burns separately in them,
is the same in its quality. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda who exhibits Himself equally in the
same mobile manner in His various manifestations.
20) I adore the primeval Lord Govinda who assuming His own great subjective form, who bears the
name of Sesha, replete with the all-accommodating potency, and reposing in the Causal Ocean with
the infinity of the world in the pores of His hair, enjoys creative sleep [yoga-nidra].
21) Brahma and other lords of the mundane worlds, appearing from the pores of hair of Maha-
Vishnu, remain alive as long as the duration of one exhalation of the latter [Maha-Vishnu]. I adore
the primeval Lord Govinda of whose subjective personality Maha-Vishnu is the portion of portion.
22) I adore the primeval Lord Govinda from whom the separated subjective portion Brahma receives
his power for the regulation of the mundane world, just as the sun manifests some portion of his own
light in all the effulgent gems that bear the names of suryakanta, etc.
23) I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, whose lotus feet are always held by Ganesa upon the pair of
tumuli protruding from his elephant head in order to obtain power for his function of destroying all
the obstacles on the path of progress of the three worlds.
24) The three worlds are composed of the nine elements, viz., fire, earth, ether, water, air, direction,
time, soul and mind. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda from whom they originate, in whom they exist
and into whom they enter at the time of the universal cataclysm.
25) The sun who is the king of all the planets, full of infinite effulgence, the image of the good soul, is
as the eye of this world. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda in pursuance of whose order the sun
performs his journey mounting the wheel of time.
26) I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, by whose conferred power are maintained the
manifested potencies, that are found to exist, of all virtues, all vices, the Vedas, the penances and all
jivas, from Brahma to the meanest insect.
27) I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, who burns up to their roots all fruitive activities of those who
are imbued with devotion and impartially ordains for each the due enjoyment of the fruits of
one's activities, of all those who walk in the path of work, in accordance with the chain of their
previously performed works, no less in the case of the tiny insect that bears the name of indragopa than
in that of Indra, king of the devas.
28) I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, the meditators of whom, by meditating upon Him under the
sway of wrath, amorous passion, natural friendly love, fear, parental affection, delusion, reverence
and willing service, attain to bodily forms befitting the nature of their contemplation.
29) I worship that transcendental seat, known as Svetadvipa where as loving consorts the Laksmis in
their unalloyed spiritual essence practice the amorous service of the Supreme Lord Krishna as their
only lover; where every tree is a transcendental purpose tree; where the soil is the purpose gem, all
water is nectar, every word is a song, every gait is a dance, the flute is the favorite attendant, effulgence
is full of transcendental bliss and the supreme spiritual entities are all enjoyable and tasty,
where numberless milk cows always emit transcendental oceans of milk; where there is eternal existence
of transcendental time, who is ever present and without past or future and hence is not subject to
the quality of passing away even for the space of half a moment. That realm is known as Goloka only to
a very few self-realized souls in this world.
